# Passage 7
Women who write with an overriding consciousness that they *write as women* are engaged not in aspiration toward writing but chiefly in a politics of sex. A new political term makes its appearance: *woman writer*, not used descriptively – as one would say “a lanky, brown-haired writer” – but as part of the language of politics.

Now a politics of sex can be very much to the point. No one would deny that the movement for female suffrage was a politics of sex, and obviously any agitation for equality in employment, in the professions, and in government is a politics of sex. But the language of politics is not writers’ language. Politics begins with premises; imagination goes in search of them. The political term *woman writer* signals in advance a whole set of premises: that, for instance, there are “male” and “female” states of intellect and feeling, hence of prose; that individuality of condition and temperament do not apply, or at least not much, and that all writing women possess – not by virtue of being writers but by virtue of being women – an instantly perceived common ground; that writers who are women can best nourish other writers who are women.

I deny this. There is a human component to literature that does not separate writers by sex but that – on the contrary – engenders sympathies from sex to sex, from condition to condition, from experience to experience, from like to like, and from unlike to unlike. Literature universalizes. Without disparaging particularity or identity, it universalizes; it does not divide.

Does a “woman writer” have a body of separate experience by virtue of being a woman? It was this myth-fed condition of segregation that classical feminism was created to bring to an end. Insofar as some women, and some writers who are women, have separate bodies of experience or separate psychologies, to that degree has the feminism of these women not yet asserted itself. In art, feminism is that idea which opposes segregation; which means to abolish mythological divisions; which declares that the imagination cannot be “set” free, because it is already free.

A writer – I mean now a fiction writer or a poet, an *imagining* writer – is not a sociologist, nor a social historian, nor a literary critic, nor a journalist, nor a politician. The newspeak term *woman writer* has the following sociological or political message: “Of course we believe in humanity-as-a-whole. Of course we believe that a writer is a writer, period. But let us for a little while gather together, as women, to become politically strong, strong in morale, a visible, viable social factor; as such, we will separate ourselves only temporarily, during this strengthening period, and then, when we can rejoin the world with power and dignity in our hands, we *will* rejoin it and declare ourselves for the unity of the human species. This temporary status will be our strategy in our struggle with Society.”

That is the voice of the “woman writer.” But it is a mistaken voice. Only consider: In intellectual life, a new generation comes of age every four or five years. For those who were not present at the inception of this strategy, it will not seem a strategy at all; it will be the only reality. Writers will very soon find themselves born into one of two categories, woman writer or writer, and all the writers will be expected to be male – an uninspiring social and literary atmosphere the world has known before.

  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author attributes the following argument to women writers: “But let us for a little while gather together, as women, to become politically strong . . . and then, when we can rejoin the world with power and dignity in our hands, we <i>will</i> rejoin it”.</li>
    <li>There is no suggestion that literature fails to recognize the concept. Its acceptance among writers is implicit: “Of course we believe in humanity-as-a-whole”.</li>
    <li>The passage allies itself with “feminism . . . which declares that the imagination cannot be ‘set’ free, because it is already free”.</li>
    <li>The statement about a new generation is a part of the argument <u>against</u> voluntary segregation: “the voice of ‘the woman writer’ . . . is a mistaken voice. Only consider: In intellectual life, a new generation comes of age every four or five years”.</li>

  <summary>Question 39</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>It is not feminism but the “political term <i>woman writer</i> [that] signals in advance . . . that all writing women possess – not by virtue of being writers but by virtue of being women – an instantly perceived common ground”.</li>
    <li>Feminism in the arts is explicitly defined: “In art, feminism is that idea which opposes segregation; which means to abolish mythological divisions”.</li>
    <li>It is not because of feminism but because of “the voice of ‘the woman writer’ . . . [that writers] will very soon find themselves born into one of two categories, women writer or writer”.</li>
    <li>Those who classify themselves as women writers already accept the concept: “The newspeak term <i>women writer</i> has the following . . . message: ‘Of course we believe in humanity-as-a-whole’”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 40</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author argues against the assumption that sex determines experience: “Does a ‘woman writer’ have a body of separate experience by virtue of being a woman? It was this myth-fed condition of segregation. . .”.</li>
    <li>The passage does not suggest that any writer’s freedom of political expression should be restricted. Rather, it disputes the validity and usefulness of the “political term <i>woman writer</i>” and the premises that it implies.</li>
    <li>The author asserts the unifying power of literature: “There is a human component to literature that . . . engenders sympathies from sex to sex”.</li>
    <li>The author’s approval of economic equality can be inferred: “Now a politics of sex can be very much to the point. No one would deny that . . . any agitation for equality in employment . . . is a politics of sex”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 41</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The label, by implying “a body of separate experience by virtue of being a woman . . . [assumes the] myth-fed condition of segregation that classical feminism was created to bring to an end”.</li>
    <li>The label itself is a “political term”, and those who apply it to themselves or to others are already “engaged . . . chiefly in a politics of sex”; the label is not expected to politicize those to whom it is applied.</li>
    <li>The passage does not suggest that use of the label could cause literature to lose its human component, since this component is an essential characteristic of literature: “Literature . . . universalizes; it does not divide”. It suggests, on the contrary, that those who apply the label to <i>themselves</i> are not producing literature: “Women who write with an overriding consciousness that they write <i>as women</i> are engaged not in aspiration toward writing but chiefly in a politics of sex” [because] “the language of politics is not writers’ language”.</li>
    <li>This is the author’s conclusion about the consequences of using the label <i>woman writer</i>: “Writers will very soon find themselves born into one of two categories, women writer or writer, and all the writers will be expected to be male”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 42</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This interpretation of the goals of classical feminism does not in itself preclude admiration for the writing style of a woman who apparently does not share these goals.</li>
    <li>The opinion that women who “are engaged . . . chiefly in a politics of sex” seek support in each other’s writings does not imply the belief that no such woman could produce works of literary merit.</li>
    <li>This argument against the separation of writers “into one of two categories, woman writer or writer” implies that literary merit is irrelevant to the writer’s sex. This position is consistent with admiration for the works of a writer whose talent might be underestimated because of her acceptance of the sex-linked label.</li>
    <li>Admiration for the creative works of a self-labeled <i>women writer</i> would be inconsistent with the beliefs that such women “are engaged not in aspiration toward writing but chiefly in a politics of sex” and that “an <i>imagining</i> writer – is not . . . a politician”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 43</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A sympathetic treatment of the lives of both sexes would accord with the author’s views about literature: “There is a human component to literature that . . . engenders sympathies from sex to sex, from condition to condition, from experience to experience”.</li>
    <li>An essay about a political movement would be expected to defend some premise about it. The author would thus be more likely to consider it political than literary: “Politics begins with premises; imagination goes in search of them”.</li>
    <li>An attack that pitted women against men would violate the author’s description of literature: “Without disparaging particularity or identity, [literature] universalizes; it does not divide”.</li>
    <li>A tract arguing that a voting decision should be based on sex would represent political writing rather than literature. Its implicit premise would be that “individuality of condition and temperament do not apply”.</li>
