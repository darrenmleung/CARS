# Passage 3
The Greeks were traditionally a religious people. Yet there had always been a tendency, at the same time, to treat the gods with a certain familiar flippancy – this is already very apparent in the *Iliad* and the *Homeric Hymns*. The rationalist movements of the later fifth century had subjected the reputation of the divine personages to a further battering. The inquisitive spirit of Euripides, when not (as in the *Bacchae*) interpreting the gods as profound psychological forces, was capable of presenting them as shady seducers or discredited figures of fun. And at the same time Socrates was questioning the whole traditional fabric so indefatigably that his prosecutors, who secured his death sentence, were hardly wrong to accuse him of "not believing in the gods in whom the city believes."

Then the early Hellenistic age that followed produced numerous slighting references to the Olympian powers. Many people had come to regard them as merely symbolic, and even the Stoics, for all their belief in divine Providence, reinterpreted and accommodated many individual deities as merely allegorical explanations of natural phenomena. Like Hellenistic sculptors, who began to represent some of these gods in much less idealistic forms than those their predecessors had favoured, the poets Callimachus and Theocritus showed that they were living in an age when the old gods were no longer a matter of belief or serious concern.

Other writers were even more specific. Thus the idea of Euhemerus that the gods Uranus, Cronus, and Zeus had once been great human kings upon the earth may have been a flattering gesture in favour of worshipping living monarchs as their equals; but it was also, in another sense, little more than a rationalization of atheism; and his younger contemporary Strato of Lampsacus declared that he did not need the help of the gods at all in order to construct an understandable world. Meanwhile, an Athenian's hymn to Demetrius I Poliorcetes had asserted that the gods of the city, if not non-existent, were at least indifferent: and both Menander (in passing) and Epicurus (in an elaborate series of philosophical arguments) found this latter conclusion an obviously correct one, since the traditional gods seemed able to do nothing to ease people's daily encounters with the vicissitudes of Hellenistic life. St. Paul, after such ideas had been going round for three or four centuries, understandably saw pagan Hellenism as a "world without hope – and without God."

All the same, his impression was misleading. Pagan religion was not already dying or dead when Christianity overtook it; it had remained very lively indeed. But it had deviated, and continued to deviate throughout the Hellenistic age, from the traditional mainstream of the classical Olympian cults. They continued, it is true, to receive impressive ceremonial worship, but a person of this epoch no longer pinned his or her faith on those gods, but on a number of Divine Saviours. These Saviours were relied on, passionately, for two quite distinct miraculous gifts, of which their various cults held out hopes in varying proportions: the conferment of strength and holiness to endure our present life upon this earth, and the gift of immortality and happiness after death. And so religion was not moribund at all, but turned out to be one of the most vital elements in the Hellenistic world.

  <summary>Question 15</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>In a period when obvious attacks on the Olympian gods might be severely punished, a writer would have been foolish to denigrate them consistently. The passage author indicates that Euripides’s portrayal of the gods “(as in the <i>Bacchae</i>) as profound psychological forces” was relatively favorable by contrasting it with his treatment of them elsewhere “as shady seducers or discredited figures of fun”.</li>
    <li>The divine saviors appeared in the Hellenistic age, which followed the time of Euripides.</li>
    <li>The adjective <i>inquisitive</i> refers to the spirit of Euripides, not to the gods.</li>
    <li>The negative tone of <i>figures of fun</i> is indicated both by the introductory phrase “was capable of presenting them as” and by the adjective <i>discredited</i>.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 16</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>The unelaborated designation <i>my god</i> would permit no inference about the orthodoxy of Socrates. Although the possessive pronoun <i>my</i> suggests the concept of a personal god rather than one worshipped by an entire city, and the singular noun <i>god</i> implies the exclusion of some of these gods, the statement may indicate only a preference for a particular god in the city pantheon. These points would have to be resolved to determine whether the prosecutors were correct in their accusation.</li>
    <li>Since the “Olympian powers” implicitly included “the gods in whom the city believes”, the allegiance of Socrates to one of these powers would support the accusation that he did not believe in [any] of the city gods <u>only</u> if the god in question were not also specifically associated with the city.</li>
    <li>Since the “Olympian powers” implicitly included “the gods in whom the city believes”, the demonstration that the god obeyed by Socrates was not among these powers would confirm the accusation that he did not believe in the city gods.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 17</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The discovery that Zeus was first portrayed as the source of thunder by a Stoic would imply that the identification of a god with a force of nature accorded with the Stoic philosophy, supporting the passage assertion that Stoics “reinterpreted and accommodated many individual deities as merely allegorical explanations of natural phenomena”.</li>
    <li>Although they “reinterpreted and accommodated many individual deities as merely allegorical”, the Stoics maintained “their belief in divine Providence” and are therefore contrasted, in the phrase “even the Stoics”, with those who regarded all Olympian gods as merely symbolic.</li>
    <li>The idea that Zeus is the source of thunder can be interpreted literally (as a human-like god hurling thunderbolts) as well as allegorically (as a personification of the godlike power of thunder). The former interpretation is clearly consistent with a belief in divine Providence, and the latter is not necessarily inconsistent with it.</li>
    <li>These references are not attributed to the Stoics but to an extended period of time: “the early Hellenistic age that followed produced numerous slighting references to the Olympian powers”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 18</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This assessment was that the Hellenistic religion was worthless: “St. Paul . . . saw pagan Hellenism as a ‘world without hope – and without God’”.</li>
    <li>This assertion is a conclusion based on the discussion in the final paragraph of the emergence of various influential cults devoted to a belief in divine saviors while the Olympian gods continued to receive ceremonial worship.</li>
    <li>Menander and Epicurus both wrote that the traditional city gods, if they existed, were indifferent to human misery. This conclusion implies that religion was not a vital element in the Hellenistic world.</li>
    <li>The idea that the gods had descended from humans was: “little more than a rationalization of atheism”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 19</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The two works are not identified with the rationalist movements. Furthermore, these movements are dated “in the later fifth century B.C.” and the adverb <i>further</i> indicates that this period followed the age in which the two works were produced.</li>
    <li>Homer is not explicitly identified as a poet. However, even if this knowledge is assumed, his flippant treatment of the gods in two works is not presented as indicative of the beliefs of poets in general.</li>
    <li>”The Greeks” is the subject of the first sentence of the passage. The second sentence implicitly refers to the Greeks in asserting that “there had always been a tendency . . . to treat the gods with a certain familiar flippancy” and cites the two works as clear early evidence of this tendency: “this is already very apparent in the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>”.</li>
    <li>The Athenian’s hymn proposing that the city gods were indifferent is not associated with either of the two works. Furthermore, this proposal was made “meanwhile” – i.e., during “the early Hellenistic age that followed” [the time of the rationalist movements, Euripides, and Socrates]. The hymn therefore dates from a period long after the time of Homer (see <i>rationale A</i>).</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 20</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>It is the approach of the poets Callimachus and Theocritus, not that of their pre-Hellenistic predecessors, that is likened to that of the sculptors of their time.</li>
    <li>The assertions that “there had always been a tendency . . . to treat the gods with a certain familiar flippancy” and that Euripides “was capable of presenting them as shady seducers or discredited figures of fun” do not imply that pre-Hellenistic poetry in general portrayed the gods disrespectfully. If the passage author had meant to convey this idea, the Hellenistic poets Callimachus and Theocritus would not have been characterized as “living in an age when the old gods were <u>no longer</u> a matter of belief or serious concern”.</li>
    <li>“The Greeks were traditionally a religious people”, and the attitude toward the gods attributed to the earlier Greek poets does not suggest atheism: “a certain familiar flippancy” and an assault on their reputation by Euripides, who nevertheless interpreted them “as profound psychological forces”.</li>
    <li>The comparison of Callimachus and Theocritus to “Hellenistic sculptors, who began to represent some of these gods in much less idealistic forms than those their predecessors had favoured”, implies that the poets who preceded these two had also idealized the gods. The statement that the two poets “were living in an age when the old gods were no longer a matter of belief or serious concern” also implies that earlier poetry had expressed reverence toward the gods.</li>
