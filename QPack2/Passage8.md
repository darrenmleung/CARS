# Passage 8
No matter how noble the effort, the burden of proof always lies with the reformer. Many empirically sound proposals to increase the effectiveness of elementary schools in the United States have been dismissed with the response, “If it is so necessary, why has the need not been recognized before?” To counter this response, a reformer should make clear that a problem *has* been identified.

If the condition addressed has *not* been completely and clearly established as a problem, those concerned should ensure that it is accurately measured. The appropriate instrument for measuring educational effectiveness is a test noted for its reliability and validity. If the researchers believe that no existing test is adequate, they should develop their own test. Since the burden of proof for their methods is then focused on their instrument, sincere reformers will be very serious about establishing its credentials.

When a proposed intervention is not justified in the most minimal fashion, the public has to wonder why not. It is thus reasonable to be suspicious of the promoters of the *Generalized School Readiness Program*. What is their motivation? Are they agents of an unfriendly power bent on “dumbing down” U.S. education? Are educational entrepreneurs trying cynically to profit from the general dissatisfaction with the nation’s schools?

Such speculations may appear to border on the absurd; however, stranger motivations have been discovered. It is more useful, however, to assume that the promoters, wishing to keep their business financially solvent, have opted not to address school-based problems from the viewpoint of children, or parents, or even teachers. They are merely following the usual practice at the professional level of education of treating learning as an abstraction that has little to do with the learner. This outlook is one that Jean Piaget, John Dewey, and A. L. Gesell-theoreticians with empirical evidence about children’s intellectual development-all worked to counter.

Piaget and Gesell, although from different schools of thought, also had direct experience with children in an educational setting, and both contributed profoundly useful principles to the field of education. Yet the conclusions of both about the need to consider developmental level are opposed by advocates of Generalized School Readiness.

One must wonder about the experience these self-proclaimed experts have had with children. Their description of a child learning to draw, for example, assumes a struggle from stage to stage. Most modern observers of children think that if a task is developmentally appropriate and has personal meaning for a child, it is approached as a pleasing challenge, not a struggle.

In the literature promoting their approach, the advocates of generalized readiness are clearly directing their appeal to school administrators. Parents who do not understand their “readiness” concept are dismissed as “uncaring.” Teachers who question it are described as “uninitiated,” in the sense that someday they *will* accept it. Yet this literature expresses no doubt that the administrators will cooperate with them in ensuring that their viewpoint prevails. An administrator wise enough to adopt the readiness program is promised higher percentages on standardized tests and more content teachers.

With comparative data on the results of alternative approaches as ambiguous as they are in the U.S., the odds favor acceptance by a school system of a poorly researched but slickly presented program. Readiness, although a confused approach, is easily implemented because its promoters are positioned to move immediately. *Developmentally appropriate instruction*, which parents are likely to judge the more reasonable approach, appears to be hard to sell to decision makers concerned with uniformity. In the long run, however, it is the forgotten parents and the children themselves who will pay for the short‑sighted ambition of this policy.

# Questions
### 44. The author apparently considers a theory of education that “has little to do with the learner”:
<ol type="A">
  <li>practical but unethical.</li>
  <li>ethical but not generally accepted.</li>
  <li>generally accepted but ineffective.</li>
  <li>effective but impractical.</li>
</ol>

### 45. The author argues that the reason for the approach taken by promoters of the Generalized School Readiness Program is their wish:
<ol type="A">
  <li>to control the education of U.S. consumers.</li>
  <li>to defraud the schools of a great deal of money.</li>
  <li>to promote the success of a corporate sponsor.</li>
  <li>to win the support of school administrators.</li>
</ol>

### 46. The most reasonable inference from passage statements is that administrators are relatively reluctant to institute developmentally appropriate instruction because:
<ol type="A">
  <li>it is favored by parents and therefore represents the views of those with little understanding of learning.</li>
  <li>it is based on untested theories and therefore requires extensive research to demonstrate its effectiveness.</li>
  <li>it is individualized and therefore involves an inconvenient process of changing traditional methods.</li>
  <li>it is promoted in slick presentations and therefore justifies skepticism about its cost effectiveness.</li>
</ol>

### 47. One can infer from the passage that teaching in the Generalized School Readiness Program is to developmentally appropriate teaching as:
<ol type="A">
  <li>breaking farmland with a hand plow is to preparing the fields by riding on a mechanized cultivator.</li>
  <li>sending a yearly form letter to one’s acquaintances is to sending personal notes to one’s friends.</li>
  <li>casting a line into a lake with a fishing rod is to fishing with a net behind a boat.</li>
  <li>preparing a variety of dishes in a restaurant is to cooking a family meal at home.</li>
</ol>

### 48. The performance of high school students on an examination noted for its reliability and validity is used to predict their success in college. The author’s views on such tests suggests that its scores could also be used to evaluate:
<ol type="A">
  <li>the usefulness of high school curricula.</li>
  <li>the honesty of the grading in high schools.</li>
  <li>the appropriateness of the testing principles.</li>
  <li>the probable income of the students in later life.</li>
</ol>

  <summary>Question 44</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does imply that this education may be unethical by saying, “it is the forgotten parents and children themselves who will pay for the short-sighted-ambition of this policy [based upon Generalized School Readiness theory].” However, the author does not view this theory as practical since it “has little to do with the learner,” when the author apparently believes that developmentally appropriate education has much to do with the learner. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>The author neither considers this theory of education ethical, nor generally accepted. See <i>rationales A and C</i>.</li>
    <li>By referring to the school readiness theory of education as a “usual practice . . . of treating learning as an abstraction,” the author is implying that this theory is generally accepted. The author points out that the outlook behind this theory was opposed by educational theorists Jean Piaget and A.L. Gesell who advocated developmentally appropriate, personally meaningful education for children, a view supported by observers of modern education: “Most modern observers of children think that if a task is developmentally appropriate and has personal meaning for a child, it is approached as a pleasing challenge, not a struggle.” The author implies that any educational theory that goes counter to the kind advocated by Piaget and Gesell is “ineffective.”</li>
    <li>The author considers this theory of education impractical and ineffective. See <i>rationales A and C</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 45</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author generally is suspicious of the objection that educational entrepreneurs are cynically trying to profit and does not seem to see this as an effort to control the education of U.S. consumers. The author does say that the needs of parents, teachers, and children are being ignored and bypassed in this attempt to promote the program.</li>
    <li>The author does not object to this effort on the grounds that it is attempting to defraud the schools of money, but on the grounds that it is ignores the needs of children, parents, and teachers. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The author makes no reference to promoting a corporate sponsor of the program as the reason why promoters of Generalized School Readiness are trying to sell the concept to schools.</li>
    <li>The author states: In the literature promoting their approach, the advocates of generalized readiness are clearly directing their appeal to school administrators.</li>

  <summary>Question 46</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author states that the advocates of Generalized School Readiness, not school administrators, possess this attitude and present this kind of argument to school administrators: “In the literature promoting their approach, the advocates of generalized readiness are clearly directing their appeal to school administrators. Parents who do not understand their ‘readiness’ concept are dismissed as ‘uncaring.’”</li>
    <li>This represents more the position of the author, not the feelings of school administrators. The author doubts the expertise of school readiness advocates and questions the credibility of the research behind this program: “With comparative data on the results of alternative approaches as ambiguous as they are in the U.S., the odds favor acceptance . . . of a poorly researched but slickly presented program.” By discussing the need for the credibility of reforms and pointing out that the burden of proof for needing a new program rests on the reformer, the opening two paragraphs imply the school readiness advocates have not proven the need for their program. Based on that, the author asserts that it “is reasonable to be suspicious of the promoters of the <i>Generalized School Readiness Program</i>.”</li>
    <li>The author points out: “<i>Developmentally appropriate instruction</i> . . . appears to be a hard sell to decision makers concerned with uniformity.” This statement implies that uniformity is more convenient than an individualized approach, with the added benefit of “higher percentages on standardized tests.”</li>
    <li>The author does not raise the issue of cost effectiveness in discussing this program, instead focusing on its credibility.</li>

  <summary>Question 47</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The logic of this analogy, in how the completed sentence is structured and reads, makes breaking farmland with a hand plow analogous to school readiness and mechanized agriculture analogous to developmentally appropriate instruction when the opposite would be a more apt analogy. However, even if the opposite analogy were used, breaking land with a hand plow, while a more personal way of farming that is closer to the land, is not so exact an analogy to developmentally appropriate instruction as seeing it like a personal note to a friend—the land cannot experience this interpersonal relationship like a friend can. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>This analogy is most apropos because the author contends that, much like a form letter, school readiness is too impersonal and standardized whereas developmentally appropriate instruction, much like a personal note to a friend, is focused on the individual needs of children and is designed to be personally meaningful to them.</li>
    <li>The logic of this analogy, in how the completed sentence is structured and reads, equates school readiness with using a fishing line, a more personalized way of fishing, and developmentally appropriate instruction to casting a net, which is more generalized and impersonal way of fishing. The opposite analogy would be more to the point, but, even so, making developmentally appropriate instruction analogous to fishing with a rod is not so exact an analogy as equating it with sending a personal note to a friend. Like this form of education, a personal note is an interpersonal interaction that treats the recipient of the note as an individual. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>Equating preparation of a variety of dishes in a restaurant with school readiness and equating cooking a family meal at home with developmentally appropriate education is an apt analogy—the former suggests a more impersonal mode of interaction and the latter is more personal. However, the latter, while more personal, does not necessarily imply an individualized approach, because a family home meal is directed at a more intimate <i>group</i>, not an <i>individual</i>. Therefore, this is not so exact an analogy as comparing the former to a form letter and the latter to a personal note to a friend. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
