# Passage 16
During the second half of the sixteenth century the appearance of the [Piazza della Signoria] changed considerably. Many statues and works of art were placed in the loggia and in other parts of the square, making it look rather like an open air museum. . . . The statues placed in the loggia changed the focal point of the square, so that if one looks into the square from Via dei Cerchi, which runs parallel to the main façade of the Palazzo Vecchio, one’s eye is drawn to the loggia. . . . 

The first statue one sees from this viewpoint is the *Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I*, by Giambologna, finished in 1598. The bas-reliefs at its base, and especially the one representing Cosimo’s Entrance into Siena, inspired Rubens who saw them during his visit to Florence in 1600. This monument was however the last to be placed in the square in the sixteenth century. Behind this we see the Fountain of Neptune by Ammannati, finished in 1575. This fountain probably was meant to celebrate Cosimo’s maritime successes (in fact, Neptune does bear a resemblance to the duke): but it is not the colossal and rather clumsy figure of the god, whom the Florentines rather wickedly call ‘Il Biancone’, ‘the big white one’, which attracts one’s interest, as much as the purely decorative figures around the base. Some of these sea gods and goddesses, with their stylized elongated bodies, are mannerist in style; but the satyrs, vital and full of movement, are naturalistic in a warm and sensual way. When the old Ammannati, a few years later, was seized by religious scruples under the influence of the Counter-Reformation, he apparently repented having filled his fountain with ‘so many nudes’, and even begged Cosimo to have them removed, fearing – he wrote – ‘that people might think Florence a nest of idols, or of libidinous things’. It is true that by this time Ammannati was considered very pious, but also, according to Borghini in 1583, ‘not very right in the head’.

The next statues are those lined along the steps of the palace, where the “aringhiera” used to be. The *Marzocco*, the heraldic icon lion of Florence, is only a copy of Donatello’s original, today in the Bargello. The *Judith and Holophernes*, also by Donatello, is an original, but perhaps it would be wise to remove it, to protect it both from bad weather and from the pigeons in the square. It would not be the first time this bronze has been moved; sculpted in 1456, it was suspected of bringing bad luck to the city, because “Judith is a sign of death . . . and it is not right that a woman should kill a man”, and it was substituted by Michelangelo’s *David*. So the statue was first moved into Palazzo Vecchio, then into the loggia, and was finally placed here, next to the *Marzocco*, in 1919.

The contrast between Donatello’s statue and that of Michelangelo which replaced it is immediately apparent: the former is tragic, Judith lifts her scimitar to cut off the head of the dead Holophernes; whereas the *David* is of colossal dimensions, with a calm but titanic strength, expressing the new atmosphere of the sixteenth century. This figure, almost four and a half metres high, is a paragon of beauty and strength, rather like a synthesis of Apollo and Hercules; the Romantics pointed out that this is the turning point in Michelangelo’s art, from the “sweet” to the “terrible”, although here the two manage to co-exist. This is because of the exaggerated size of this adolescent, strong but slim, calm but ready to fight. In 1873 the original was placed in the Academy and this statue is a copy. It is, however, necessary to look at this copy, where it stands, to form an idea of what the original impression was: in front of the enormous palace and in the open space of the square, the *David* must have looked quite different. It has been said that it is impossible for anyone today to understand the *David*, situated as it is in the Academy, where everything about it appears grotesquely out of proportion.

  <summary>Question 86</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Only one (the Fountain of Neptune) of the five works of art mentioned in the passage is by Ammannati, so this option can be eliminated.</li>
    <li>This option can be keyed by using the method of elimination, even if the references to Neptune from classical mythology and those from the Bible (“Judith” and “David” from the story of David and Goliath) are not recognized.</li>
    <li>The Counter-Reformation is mentioned only at the end of paragraph 2, so this option can be eliminated.</li>
    <li>Only one (the Equestrian) of the five works mentions Rubens, and it inspires him rather than being inspired <i>by</i> him, so this option can be eliminated.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 87</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>“David” “is the turning point in Michelangelo’s art, from the ‘sweet’ to the ‘terrible’”, so work prior to “David” would be ‘sweet’ the only work of Donatello described in the passage is described as “tragic”.</li>
    <li>None of the art mentioned in the passage is described as classical.</li>
    <li>Work before “David” is described as “sweet”—making this option the best of the four since ‘sweetness’ is most consistent with work that is ‘calm’.</li>
    <li>No before-and-after distinction is made in the passage with regard to artistic subject matter.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 88</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage refers to copies twice (paragraphs 3 and 4), associating originals in the same paragraph with vulnerability to “bad weather” and pigeons. Option (I) is therefore plausible. Is not, however, the only plausible option.</li>
    <li>The passage refers to the practice of moving sculptures into buildings and it is reasonable to infer that the mentioned buildings are museums (the Bargello; Palazzo Vecchio; the Academy). Option (II) is thus also plausible, but not the only correct answer.</li>
    <li>It contains both plausible options—the first dealing with using copies as opposed to exposing original works of art to outdoor hazards; the second with moving original statutes indoors, into what appear to be museums or galleries.</li>
    <li>Nothing about protective barriers is mentioned in the passage.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 89</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The quotation in paragraph 2,“Some of these . . . are mannerist in style; <i>but</i> the satrys . . . are naturalistic in a warm and sensual way” implies that mannerism and naturalism are dissimilar or complete opposites.</li>
    <li>The reference to sweet and terrible elements (final paragraph) is independent of the implied description of mannerism that precedes it in paragraph 2.</li>
    <li>Libidinous imagery would describe sensual satyrs, which are naturalistic rather than mannerist.</li>
    <li>“Some of these . . . with their stylized elongated bodies, are mannerist in style” makes it clear that these are characteristics of mannerism.</li>
  </ol>
