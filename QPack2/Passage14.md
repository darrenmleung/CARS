# Passage 14
Television is not the "dream factory" which Hollywood was once said to be by dour sociologists: it is a reality factory. It is truer to life than life is. Television convinces us by immediacy and by repetition, not by structured argument or oratorical exposition. A lack of articulacy is the badge of sincerity; grammar smacks of premeditation. "Series" dominate all program planning. What has been said before – "characters" we have seen before, advertisements we "love" – may well be the evidence that originality (what has never been said before) has scant future on the box. Malcolm Muggeridge has spoken of the numbing effect of the plethora of news. By hosing us with "information" the networks affect to keep us fully up-to-date with the world, yet the segmentation and "personalization" of the "news" actually confuse us with their discontinuous gush, so that we are less set free by the "truth" than addicted to it, not least because it seems always about to tell us something. Frustration accompanies even our most emotional responses: the eyes fill with tears, the lump engorges the throat, as victims or survivors appear on our screens, but catharsis does not follow, nor (in almost all cases) does any active response, in political or social terms. The reward of being a viewer depends on staying passive – if we are moved to leave the viewing chair we may miss the next program. Such movement then is rarely any part of a newscaster's program: "stay tuned" is the eleventh and commanding commandment.

What is the language of television? The truth is that it cannot be isolated, for if I am right, television is a voracious recycler and mixer of a confluence of concepts. "Basic television" has no *distinct* vocabulary: it eavesdrops and cadges with relentless parasitism, but it has no specific dictionary, merely a character, or characters.

Being true to life will soon be better (more authentic) than life itself. Television, in fact, suggests that it is already: even television drama, with its almost inescapable naturalism, is more quotidian, so to say, than everyday life. The regularity of its series provides a clock and a monitor by which reality itself is calibrated. "Time for Kojak" becomes a normal way of announcing where we are in the day, while Kojak himself, at the peak of his powers and popularity, gave police officers–as do and did other realistic programs – an indication of how they should behave (and how the public would expect them to behave) if they were to maintain credibility. "As seen on TV" thus becomes a guarantee of quality, not only in advertised products, but in human behavior at large.

Mass communication communicates massively: its language lacks precise articulation and avoids demanding terms; it argues for the kind of behavior in life which will make a "good program." Television writes our scripts and it thus gives us back our language in a verisimilitudinous revision, docked of amateurish or embarrassing passions or obsessions which might cause our audience to switch off.

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 76</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Implicitly, television newscasters intend to induce passivity, since “the reward of being a viewer depends on staying passive–if we are moved to leave the viewing chair we may miss the next program. Such movement then is rarely any part of a newscaster’s program: ‘stay tuned’ is the eleventh and commanding commandment”.</li>
    <li>According to the passage, victims or survivors on the screen arouse the viewer’s emotions, “but catharsis does not follow”, implicitly because of the immediate replacement of one segment by the next in “the plethora of news . . . hosing us with ‘information’”.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>In stating that “the segmentation and ‘personalization’ of the ‘news’ actually confuse us with their discontinuous gush”, the passage does not suggest that newscasters deliberately attempt to confuse their viewers.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 77</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The apparent authenticity of televised drama is not attributed to the quality of the acting but to the careful naturalism of the language: “grammar smacks of premeditation”. The suggestion that people model their behavior on that of television characters, learning to enact “the kind of behavior in life which will make a ‘good program’”, also concerns the influence of television’s depersonalized language and familiar scripts, not the skill of its actors: “Television writes our scripts”.</li>
    <li>According to the author, it is the language of mass communication that “lacks precise articulation” because it follows the principle that “a lack of articulacy is the badge of sincerity”.</li>
    <li>The characterization of television viewers as “passive” and the suggestion that television drama sets standards for real-life interpersonal behavior are separate ideas. The passage does not suggest that the passivity encouraged by television viewing is expressed in human relationships.</li>
    <li>The charge that television “gives us back our language . . . docked of amateurish or embarrassing passions or obsessions which might cause our audience to switch off” suggests that the emotions expressed in a genuine disagreement would be inconsistent with the conventions of television scripts.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 78</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author bases this conclusion directly on the repetitiveness of television: “‘characters’ we have seen before, advertisements we ‘love’– may well be the evidence that originality (what has never been said before) has scant future on the box”.</li>
    <li>The comments about the domination of programming by “series” and the immediately following idea, attributed to Malcolm Muggeridge, that the plethora of news has a numbing effect on viewers, are implicitly related in that both concern repetition. However, the author does not imply that repetition has a numbing effect on viewers of nonnews programs.</li>
    <li>According to the passage, it is the naturalism and regular recurrence of television dramatic programs that give viewers a sense of authenticity. Although the characters and commercials seen in a series would necessarily become familiar to viewers, the author does not cite this familiarity as a reason for the conclusion that television seems more authentic than life itself.</li>
    <li>No evidence is offered for the assertion that “television convinces us by immediacy and by repetition”. The familiarity of the language, plots, characters, and advertisements of television is mentioned as an aspect of its repetitive nature, not as evidence that it is convincing.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 79</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not suggest that other television critics generally oppose serialized dramas.</li>
    <li>A news show characterized by a rapid progression of images and by simple language would accord with the author’s reference to the “discontinuous gush” of such programs.</li>
    <li>The presence on television of an appealing character whose speech is both passionate and articulate would challenge the passage author’s contentions that “a lack of articulacy is the badge of sincerity” and that television language is “docked of amateurish or embarrassing passions”.</li>
    <li>A series that combined recycled plots from various sources would support the author’s charge that “television is a voracious recycler and mixer of a confluence of concepts”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 80</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Viewers who felt the full impact of their emotions (as opposed to simply experiencing a rapidly alternating sequence of unresolved emotional responses) might be moved to leave the viewing chair to take political or social action. According to the passage argument, such a consequence would be contrary to programming goals.</li>
    <li>"A 'good program" is presumably a rewarding one for the viewer, and “the reward of being a viewer depends on staying passive”.</li>
    <li>According to the author, television does not convince us “by structured argument or oratorical exposition”. “A ‘good program’” is one that avoids dealing intelligently with passionately held ideas.</li>
    <li>A preference for “what has been said before – ‘characters’ we have seen before, advertisements we ‘love’” implies that interesting and unusual aspects of everyday life would not be considered suitable topics.</li>
  </ol>
