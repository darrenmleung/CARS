# Passage 9
In the years before the turn of the century, the Mediterranean fleet, the cream of the navy, reached a peak of Victorian splendor. The great ships would silently appear from over the horizon to manifest the majesty and power of England. Gold-encrusted admirals came ashore to call on local dignitaries, officers to attend balls, play polo, or hunt snipe. Fierce competition in sail drill gave way to equally passionate competition among ships in races at fleet regattas or timed coaling contests.

The fiercest competition of all was in polishing the ships. Every metal surface in the Mediterranean fleet blazed like the sun. Battleship and cruiser crews devoted enormous energy to burnishing the great guns. Massive armored watertight doors were taken off their hinges and filed and rubbed until they gleamed–and were no longer watertight. On some ships, even the ring bolts on deck were polished and fitted with little flannel nightcaps to protect them from salt air between inspections.

This cult of brightwork originated in the need to keep the men busy. When sails gave way to steam, the time given to tending the rigging, furling and mending sails, straightening and coiling ropes was given instead to polishing. The process made men’s hands and clothes filthy with metal polish, and as soon as salt spray hit the gleaming metal, copper turned green again and brass blue. A sparkling ship reflected well on the captain and his second in command, and commanders spent large sums out of their private pockets, often far more than they could afford. “It was customary,” wrote Sir Percy Scott, “for a commander to spend half his pay in buying paint to adorn Her Majesty’s ships, as it was the only road to promotion.”

Appearances were often deceiving. “When I went to sea in 1895,” wrote Vice Admiral K. G. B. Dewar, “an air of spic and span smartness became the criterion by which ships were judged. In my first ship . . . the basins in the gunroom latrine had to be polished till they shone like mirrors, the doors being locked to prevent them being used. . . . The Hawke glistened . . . but she was infested with rats which contaminated the food, ran over the hammocks, and swarmed into the gunroom at night.”

One aspect of shipboard life that no one worried much about was gunnery; the few officers who did worry were ridiculed as fanatics. The most persuasive reason was that firing the guns spread dirt and grime. Wrote Scott acidly, “the powder then used had a most deleterious effect on the paintwork, and one commander who had his whole ship enameled told me that it cost him a hundred pounds to repaint her after target practice.”

Gunnery could not be wholly avoided, as admiralty orders decreed that target practice be held once every three months. “No one except the gunnery lieutenant took much interest in the results,” recalled Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt. “Polo and pony racing were much more important than gun drill.” Nevertheless, the ammunition had to be disposed of. On the designated day, the flagship hoisted the signal. Ships then steamed off in all directions and did as they liked. Many simply loaded the guns and pumped three months’ allowance of ammunition at the horizon. A few ships quietly dumped the shells overboard. There was little risk; admirals understood the nasty way the gun smoke dirtied a ship. Indeed, when flagships engaged in target practice, their admirals often remained ashore to escape the din.

  <li>Areas of a ship were sometimes inaccessible to the crew.</li>
</ol>

### 50. Before the wooden-hulled sailing ships were completely replaced by metal-hulled steamships, the British fleet included hybrid ships with both sails and steam engines. The most reasonable expectation on the basis of passage information is that officers on these ships avoided using:
<ol type="A">
  <li>the engines because of respect for the British sailing tradition.</li>
  <li>the engines because of concern about the effect of smoke on the sails.</li>
  <li>the sails because of the sailors’ lack of training in handling the rigging.</li>
  <li>the sails because of enthusiasm for the efficiency of the new technology.</li>
</ol>

### 51. In 1904, a recently appointed first lord of the admiralty attempted to improve the preparedness of the navy despite strong opposition. One could infer from the passage that the reform proposals focused on:
<ol type="I">
  <li>the establishment of strict gunnery practice.</li>
  <li>an emphasis on practicality over appearance.</li>
  <li>the elimination of busywork chores and ceremony.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="A">
  <li>II only</li>
  <li>III only</li>
  <li>I and II only</li>
  <li>I and III only</li>
</ol>

### 52. Which of the following underlying reasons for the practices described in the passage is the most reasonable?
<ol type="A">
  <li>A gleaming, majestic Mediterranean fleet had an important political value.</li>
  <li>The naval officers were following the misguided demands of the queen.</li>
  <li>The admiralty wanted to avoid expenditures on ammunition and repainting after gunnery practice.</li>
  <li>The British navy was so superior to any other that military drills were unnecessary.</li>
</ol>

### 53. The author’s apparent point in referring to the polishing of the ring bolts is that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>absurd measures were taken to preserve appearances.</li>
  <li>innovative methods were developed to meet distinctive challenges.</li>
  <li>beautification measures could interfere with function.</li>
  <li>naval standards were meticulous in the smallest details.</li>
</ol>

### 54. If the passage information is correct, what inference is justified by the fact that British warships functioned well in World War I, fifteen years after the period described?
<ol type="A">
  <li>The expertise of naval officers at the turn of the century compensated for the inadequate training of their crews.</li>
  <li>The battle conditions for which the navy had prepared at the turn of the century were those it encountered in the war.</li>
  <li>The complaints of gunnery officers about the preparation of their crews had been heeded.</li>
  <li>The navy of the German invaders had been trained by the methods described in the passage.</li>
</ol>

# Answers

  <summary>Question 49</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author refers to watertight doors that were no longer watertight because they had been “taken off their hinges and filed and rubbed until they gleamed” as an example of the sacrificing of function to appearance.</li>
    <li>The implied reason that a crew might dispose of the shells allotted to gunnery practice by quietly jettisoning them is that “firing the guns spread dirt and grime”, evidence that naval commanders allowed British power in the Mediterranean to become more symbolic than real.</li>
    <li>The author mentions “coaling contests” only to indicate that competitiveness among ships of the British Mediterranean fleet did not diminish when steam power supplanted sails. This information does not support the passage thesis, that this competitiveness was carried to absurd extremes in the “cult of brightwork”.</li>
    <li>The preservation of an area in a pristine state by the exclusion of those whom it was designed to serve exemplifies the false priorities discussed by the author.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 50</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage does not imply that respect for tradition was the reason for the practices described. Presumably, the new technology was even more effective than the old at manifesting “the majesty and power of England”, which the officers <u>were</u> motivated to uphold, since it was reflected in the privileged life they led in foreign ports. The author’s sole reference to a sailing tradition that was a source of pride-contests involving efficiency in handling sails-does not indicate that its loss was regretted; it simply “gave way” to equally intense contests involving speed.</li>
    <li>If admirals condoned the avoidance of gunnery practice because of “the nasty way the gun smoke dirtied a ship”, a concern that sails would become dingy because of smoke from the stacks was probably also prevalent among commanders, suggesting that officers on board would have discouraged the unnecessary use of supplementary engines.</li>
    <li>The information that sailors on sailing ships were kept busy “tending the rigging, furling and mending sails, straightening and coiling ropes” implies that they were trained to do these tasks.</li>
    <li>The passage does not mention the officers’ views on the relative efficiency of steam versus wind power. In reference to work done by the crew, however, it implies that the new technology entailed a <u>reduction</u> in efficiency: “When sails gave way to steam, the time given to tending the rigging was given instead to polishing”.</li>

  <summary>Question 51</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li><i>Option II</i> is correct, but so is <i>option I</i>.</li>
    <li>The elimination of naval customs that were not strictly necessary (<i>option III</i>) would undermine “the need to keep the men busy” without improving the navy’s ability to perform more essential duties. Similarly, the elimination of military ceremony would not, in itself, enhance preparedness. Furthermore, ceremonial occasions, as when “gold-encrusted admirals came ashore to call on local dignitaries”, would “manifest the majesty and power of England”, which the new lord of the admiralty would be pledged to uphold.</li>
    <li>The navy’s preparedness for military engagements would be furthered by the establishment of regular gunnery practice that used targets and emphasized firing accuracy (<i>option I</i>), as opposed to activities that only disposed of ammunition. Since an obsessive concern with polished surfaces could compromise the function of warships–e.g., gleaming armored doors that “were no longer watertight” – preparedness would also be fostered by a greater emphasis on practicality than on appearance (<i>option II</i>).</li>

<details>
  <summary>Question 52</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Apparently, the British fleet in the Mediterranean had no challengers, since officers who worried about gunnery “were ridiculed as fanatics”. The passage suggests that this dominance was buttressed by a policy of intimidation, which was enhanced by the resplendent appearance of the ships, on which “every metal surface blazed like the sun”.</li>
    <li>Although ships of the British navy are formally designated as “her Majesty’s”, the passage does not suggest that the queen directed their operation. Rather, the navy was evidently controlled by a military agency, which issued “admiralty orders”.</li>
    <li>A concern by the admiralty with expenditures would be shown by orders to conserve supplies. Yet “admiralty orders decreed that target practice be held once every three months”, apparently without provisions ensuring the efficiency of this practice. The cost of the nonessential repainting of ships would not concern the admiralty, since it was a private expense voluntarily undertaken by the commanders of each ship.</li>
    <li>The passage provides no evidence that the British navy excelled militarily. Rather, the author implies that the impression of power conveyed by the great ships was deceptive, since shipboard practices were inefficient, while irresponsibility and complacency prevailed among those in command.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 53</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The detail that “little flannel nightcaps” were fitted to ring bolts to preserve their polish not only evokes a ludicrous image but implies that even the most utilitarian fittings were treated only as decorative elements, exemplifying the absurdity of the “cult of brightwork”. The words “between inspections” compounds the absurdity, implying that the shiny ring bolts remained flannel covered most of the time, surely detracting from the intended impression of a stately and gleaming ship.</li>
    <li>The passage presents several examples in support of the argument that excessive attention was given to appearances. In accord with this message, the author does not present the dulling effect on metal of salt air as a challenge to be met but as a matter not worthy of the attention it received, stressing that this attention involved <u>even</u> the ring bolts.</li>
    <li>Although the author indicates in reference to other beautification measures that they could compromise function, no information is provided to justify the conclusion that the measures taken to protect the ring bolts reduced their effectiveness.</li>
    <li>A standard of brightness that extended to ring bolts was undoubtedly meticulous. However, the author’s intention, as shown by the preceding examples of burnished guns and gleaming but leaking doors is not to commend this attention to detail but to show its frivolity.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 54</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author implies that the only qualifications expected of British naval officers before the twentieth century were the abilities “to attend balls, play polo, or hunt snipe”and quotes the opinion that “polo and pony racing were much more important [to them] than gun drill”.</li>
    <li>The author does not indicate that any preparation for naval battle occurred at the beginning of the previous century and asserts that the few officers who worried about the lack of gunnery training “were ridiculed as fanatics”.</li>
    <li>According to the passage, serious gunnery practice did not occur before 1900. Reportedly, “no one except the gunnery lieutenant took much interest in the results”. Yet the information that British warships functioned well in World War I implies that their crews had been successfully trained to perform under combat conditions. A reasonable inference from these premises would be that an increase in international tensions during the fifteen years between these periods increased the responsiveness of naval commanders to negative reports by gunnery officers , leading them to enforce a policy of training for warfare.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale B</i>. (Response D is implausible even if interpreted to mean that the German navy was as <u>untrained</u> as the British, since it identifies Germany as the invader.)</li>
