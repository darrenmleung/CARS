# Passage 10
Human rights as an idea, as an issue in religious, political, and moral philosophy, has an ancient and illustrious pedigree. The English *Bill of Rights*, and more emphatically the U.S. *Declaration of Independence* and the French *Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen*, were all based on the idea of inalienable, universal, and absolute rights. Nor is it true that the idea of human rights is an invention alien to most non-Western cultures and that it has been foisted on a more or less unwilling world. Even if there were no explicit covenants to that effect in traditional societies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the idea of freedom was hardly alien to those civilizations.

Throughout the last century, it was commonly argued that international law concerned states alone, but this interpretation is no longer widely held. A new approach manifested itself in the *Atlantic Charter* of 1941, in the *Declaration of the United Nations* the year after, and in countless speeches of wartime leaders. This new approach found expression in the *United Nations Charter* and, more specifically, in the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights*, approved without a dissenting voice in December 1948. The president of the General Assembly, Dr. H. V. Evatt of Australia, said at the time that this was the first occasion on which the organized world community had recognized the existence of human rights and fundamental freedoms transcending the laws of sovereign states.

But although millions of men and women have indeed turned to the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights*, they have received very little guidance and no help from the organization that propagated it. The failure of the United Nations to live up to early expectations and to become an effective instrument for the promotion of human rights has induced individual governments and nongovernmental bodies to take fresh initiatives in this area. In 1947, the Organization of American States passed a declaration on the rights and duties of humankind; in 1950, the Council of Europe agreed on a covenant for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and established the European Commission for Human Rights as well as a European court in Strasbourg that has heard many cases since it first met in 1960. Various private bodies, such as the International League for Human Rights, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, have published reports about conditions of oppression in various parts of the world, drawing attention to particularly flagrant violations, and on occasion mobilizing public support to bring pressure on the governments concerned.

It was clear from the very beginning that the walls of oppression would not crumble at the first clarion call. The cultural and social context, the level of development of each country, are factors that have to be taken into account. What has especially to be considered is the general trend in a country: Has there been a movement *toward* greater human rights or *away* from them? However underdeveloped a country, there is no convincing argument in favor of torture, of arbitrary execution, of keeping sections of a population or a whole people in a state of slavery. The case for human rights is unassailable.

  <summary>Question 55</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  The relevance of all three options to the human rights record of a country is indicated by the lines “The cultural and social context, the level of development of each country, are factors that have to be taken into account. What has especially to be considered is the general trend in a country: Has there been a movement <i>toward</i> greater human rights or <i>away</i> from them?”.

  <summary>Question 56</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The declaration “Nor is it true that the idea of human rights is an invention alien to most non-Western cultures” means that the idea was <u>known</u> to non-Western cultures, not that they invented it.</li>
    <li>The assertion that “in traditional societies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the idea of freedom was hardly alien” indicates that non-Western cultures understood human rights before being exposed to Western ideas.</li>
    <li>The author dismisses any suggestion that non-Western cultures initially resisted the Western concept of human rights: “Nor is it true that the idea . . . has been foisted on a more or less unwilling world”.</li>
    <li>The words “Even if there were no explicit covenants to that effect in traditional societies” indicate the author’s belief that no such covenants predating those of Western cultures existed.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 57</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The writers of the U.S. and French documents represented historically recent Western cultures.</li>
    <li>The English document is mentioned only as the weakest of the three examples; there is no suggestion that it might be perceived as the <u>only</u> such document: “The English <i>Bill of Rights</i>, and more emphatically the U.S. <i>Declaration of Independence</i> and the French <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen”</i>.</li>
    <li>The documents were “based on the idea of . . . universal . . . rights”. In addition, two of them were called declarations (statements of principle), so they were apparently not explicit laws, and the identification of each with a country indicates that their scope was national, not international.</li>
    <li>These examples are cited to support the argument that “Human rights as an idea has an ancient and illustrious pedigree. The . . . U.S. <i>Declaration of Independence</i> and the French <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</i>, were all based on the idea”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 58</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage implies that <u>any</u> progress, even if gradual and incomplete, should be encouraged: “It was clear . . . that the walls of persecution would not crumble at the first clarion call. . . . What has especially to be considered is the general trend in a country”.</li>
    <li>There is no implication that a country with a leader apparently committed to democratic reforms should be shown mistrust. The only monitoring initiatives mentioned are directed to ongoing “conditions of oppression”.</li>
    <li>There is no suggestion that past persecutions might be forgiven. Furthermore, the declaration that “However underdeveloped a country, there is no convincing argument in favor of . . . keeping segments of a population . . . in a state of slavery”, while addressing ongoing conditions, also implies that leaders who have violated human rights should be held responsible for their abuse of power.</li>
    <li>The passage implies that an underdeveloped country that is moving toward greater human rights should not necessarily be censured for progressing slowly, since economic conditions are mitigating circumstances: “the level of development . . . [has] to be taken into account”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 59</summary>

  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 60</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A declaration of the right of citizens to disobey unjust laws is consistent with the general argument for “inalienable, universal, and absolute rights”.</li>
    <li>The position that countries have a right to manage their internal affairs without outside interference is contrary to the recognition of “fundamental freedoms transcending the laws of sovereign states”.</li>
    <li>The comment that governments may implement human rights laws at differential rates is implied by the discussion of “cultural and social . . . factors that have to be taken into account”.</li>
    <li>The warning that even with the passage of universal human rights laws, oppression will not immediately stop echoes the prediction that “the walls of oppression would not crumble at the first clarion call”.</li>
