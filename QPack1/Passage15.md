# Passage 15
The relationship of the professional artist to the class that ruled or aspired to rule was complicated, various and should not be simplified. The artist's training however – and it was training which made the artist a professional – taught the artist a set of conventional skills. That is to say, the artist became skilled in using a set of conventions of composition, drawing, perspective, chiaroscuro, anatomy, poses, symbolism. And these conventions corresponded so closely to the social experience – or anyway to the social manners – of the class the artist was serving, that they were not even seen as conventions but were thought of as the only way of recording and preserving eternal truths. Yet to the other social classes such professional painting appeared to be so remote from their own experience, that they saw it as a mere social convention, a mere accoutrement of the class that ruled over them: which is why in moments of revolt, painting and sculpture were often destroyed.

During the 19th century certain artists, for consciously social or political reasons, tried to extend the professional tradition of painting, so that it might express the experience of other classes. Their personal struggles, their failures, and the opposition they met with, were a measure of the ambition of the undertaking. Perhaps one pedestrian example will give some idea of the extent of the difficulties involved. Consider Ford Madox Brown's well known painting of *Work*. It shows a team of laborers, with passersby and bystanders, working on a sidewalk. It took the painter ten years to complete, and it is, at one level, extremely accurate. But it looks like a religious scene. Some would argue that this is because the artist's attitude to his subject was ambivalent I would argue that all the visual means he was using with such care preempted the possibility of depicting manual work, as the main subject of a painting, in any but a mythological or symbolic way.

The crisis provoked by those who tried to extend the area of experience to which painting might be open continued into the 20th century. But its terms were reversed. The tradition was indeed dismantled. Yet, except for the introduction of the Unconscious, the area of experience from which most European artists drew remained surprisingly unchanged. Consequently, most of the serious art of the period dealt either with the experience of various kinds of isolation, or with the narrow experience of painting itself. The latter produced painting about painting, abstract art.

One of the reasons the potential freedom gained by the dismantling of the tradition was not used may be the way painters were still trained. In the academies and art schools they first learnt those very conventions which were being dismantled. This was because no other professional body of knowledge existed to be taught.

Thus, the extreme of abstract art demonstrates, as an epilogue, the original uncertainty of professional art: an art in reality concerned with a selective, very reduced area of experience, which nevertheless claims to be universal.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 86</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The complexity of the relationship between artists and the class they served is mentioned only to introduce the topic of the traditional skills that artists acquired through formal training.</li>
    <li>The author’s point is not that strong academic strictures were required to induce artists to paint in a way that would please their patrons but that artists accepted the prevalent approach to painting “as the only way of recording and preserving eternal truths”.</li>
    <li>The argument that art training through the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries perpetuated conventions that reflected the experiences of a vanishing ruling class is introduced in the first paragraph. This argument is developed through the example of a work that seemed to defy these conventions but in fact could not escape them. It is summarized in the last two paragraphs.</li>
    <li>The opposition encountered by artists who attempted unconventional approaches is mentioned as only one of the factors indicating the ambition of this attempt. It is not discussed, and it is not attributed to a particular social stratum.</li>

  <summary>Question 87</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author implicitly disputes the existence of eternal artistic truths “these conventions . . . were not even seen as conventions”. Accordingly, the passage offers no value judgment about any specific approach to painting.</li>
    <li><i>Tradition</i> is used in reference to “the professional tradition of painting” that “certain artists . . . tried to extend . . . so that it might express the experience of other classes”. The experience that this tradition expressed at the time were those of “the class the artist was serving”, previously identified as “the class that ruled”. The usage of the term elsewhere in the passage–the “tradition was indeed dismantled” and the “dismantling of the tradition” – confirms that it refers to artistic conventions that the author identifies with a ruling elite.</li>
    <li>The passage provides no particulars about the way such conventions of traditional European painting were used.</li>
    <li>The inclusion of psychological concepts in artistic experience is presented as an <u>exception</u> to the tradition: “except for the introduction of the Unconscious, the area of experience from which most European artists drew remained surprisingly unchanged”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 88</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author argues that the art training that continued into the twentieth century restricted much painting to the expression of conventional skills, corresponding to the experiences of a single class, even though artists had in principle been freed from reliance on such conventions. Implicitly, therefore, the author believes that the best art transcends conventions.</li>
    <li>The author apparently rejects the concept of “eternal truths” that can be recorded in art. Even art that claims to be universal because it goes to the extreme of abstraction is “in reality concerned with a selective, very reduced area of experience”.</li>
    <li>The author contends that representational art in the European tradition necessarily reflects social manners: “these conventions corresponded so closely to the social experience – or anyway to the social manners – of the class the artist was serving”. There is no suggestion that this art is better than other art for this reason.</li>
    <li>The weakness of Brown’s painting, <i>Work</i>, is the intrusion of conventions associated with religious iconography into a supposedly realistically depicted contemporary street scene: “But it looks like a religious scene”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 89</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author applies the terms <i>isolation</i> and <i>narrow</i> to serious art of the twentieth century that indicated the dismantling of the tradition in European painting. They do not refer to the ruling classes.</li>
    <li>Certain nineteenth-century artists apparently did <u>not</u> believe the ruling classes to be especially worthy of commemoration, since “for consciously social or political reasons, [they] tried to extend the professional tradition of painting, so that it might express the experience of other classes”.</li>
    <li>There is no indication that artists were motivated by greed for wealth or ambition for power. The only political goal attributed to them is altruistic – to use painting “to express the experience of [the previously ignored] classes”.</li>
    <li>The manners that determined the conventions of art were those “of the class the artist was serving”. That is, art reflected the training, assumptions, and sentiments of the wealthy because it was only through their patronage that artists could continue to paint.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 90</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author describes the painting in order to make the point that despite admirable social intentions and ten years of effort, with “all the visual means [used] with such care”, a professional artist of the nineteenth century could not succeed in depicting ordinary life “in any but a mythological or symbolic way”.</li>
    <li>The subject matter (laborers at work, surrounded by passers-by) might be powerful, but the description indicates that Ford did not convey this reality in a powerful way. The author says only that “at one level, it is extremely accurate [and that] it looks like a religious scene”. This description implicitly dismisses the painting as a painstakingly rendered, static tableau, lacking the force and boldness appropriate to its mundane, urban subject.</li>
    <li>The passage is written in the past tense, and it does not mention the present. Its most recent reference is to a crisis that continued into the twentieth century for some finite length of time referred to only as “the period”.</li>
    <li>The example illustrates just one aspect of the complex relationship between artists and the ruling classes – the inability of artists to wholly rid their art of the conventions favored by these classes – and its discussion does not suggest that this complexity serves art. In particular, it indicates that conventions of religious art that once made it congenial to the ruling-class were inappropriate for a twentieth-century secular painting.</li>
