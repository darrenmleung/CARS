# Passage 11
In a fundamental sense, every person is morally responsible for deciding what is right and what is wrong and acting accordingly. This responsibility is often an uncomfortable burden, and you may wish to be rid of it, to pass it on to someone else.

But responsibility for your actions is not transferable. To say “I hereby promise to obey Fred, no matter what he commands, right or wrong” is an immoral attempt to forfeit your autonomy. After all, to say that you had, in fact, made someone else responsible for your actions would mean that you had, somehow, enslaved your will to someone else’s will, had made yourself figuratively a puppet. Fortunately, it is not possible. Having made a promise to obey, one is still in fact free to obey or disobey, to keep or break that promise.

Now although it may seem rather bizarre to talk about obeying Fred no matter what, it does follow that for exactly the same reasons, you may not say, “I will obey the government even if it tells me to do the wrong thing.” You cannot hand over your autonomy willy-nilly to Fred or the government or anyone else. If you are told to do something, you must examine it to see if it is right or wrong before deciding whether to obey it or not.

Therefore, if the government requires a moral person to act in a particular fashion and that person complies, it is because the person believes it to be the right thing to do, not simply because the government requires it. That the government does require a particular behavior may be an important factor to be taken into account, but the final arbiter is the individual.

No government, no body of people, no position, no individual can have moral authority over any other individual.

Of course, the responsible individual will often have to take into account what other individuals are doing when that individual is calculating the consequences of her or his action. The fact that the government has decreed “Everyone shall drive on the left” may result in people so arranging themselves, and conformity with the traffic flow is a desirable thing. However, it is the fact that people are driving on the left, or the fact that frequently in social situations order is beneficial, that makes conformity commendable, not the fact that a government requires it.

But I will say a little about one peculiar objection–the distrust of individual conscience. Imagine someone throwing up his or her hands in horror and crying, “But you cannot let people decide for themselves what is right and wrong. They could decide anything.” But if I surrender my decision-making responsibility to anyone, that person could come up with anything, too. Since someone has to decide what is the right thing for me to do, it may as well be me. In fact, morally, it has to be.

A government is made up of individuals who are fundamentally similar to me, and “to err is human” applies to us all. Sometimes a government member may claim to have access to more information or expertise in a particular matter, in which case I will listen to that person and may very well go along with him or her because I believe that to be a strategy more likely to achieve a satisfactory result. Certainly, if you are ignorant, consult an expert, but when to consult, whom to consult, and how to decide between conflicting experts is still the individual’s problem. And so is the final decision.

  <summary>Question 66</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>While it is true that the objector does not in any way imply that people should be forced to disobey their consciences, this idea is relevant, because that is the very point the author is trying to make by answering this objection: “You cannot hand over your autonomy willy-nilly to . . . the government or anyone else. If you are told to do something, you must examine to see if it is right or wrong before deciding whether to obey or not.”</li>
    <li>While the author does say that the responsibility for deciding right or wrong and acting on it is an uncomfortable burden, the author still contends that an individual must accept this responsibility rather than make it someone else’s responsibility. Therefore, just because the author acknowledges this burden does not make it any less relevant, because the author also does not absolve the individual of this burden.</li>
    <li>The objector does not say that politicians are better decision makers than anyone else, so the argument that politicians could “decide anything” is relevant. The author reinforces that argument by saying: “A government is made up of individuals who are fundamentally similar to me, and to ‘err is human’ applies to us all.” The author concedes that a government leader or official may be more well informed or expert in a particular issue. Therefore, an individual could accept the decision on the basis that the decision is likelier to achieve a better outcome, but even the decision to decide whether the government is right or wrong still is the responsibility of the individual.</li>
    <li>This implication, while relevant, is less relevant than the implication that individuals have a responsibility to obey their conscience, even if government officials are obeying theirs, because “responsibility for your [own] actions is not transferable,” even to government officials who are obeying their consciences. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 67</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>This hypothetical case would not support the author’s position that other people matter, because a person with this psychological condition would be incapable of thinking of other people and would only think about not breaking promises, no matter the effect on other people or on individual responsibility for decisions.</li>
    <li>The author commits somewhat of a logical fallacy by asserting that it is impossible to surrender responsibility. One could do so freely—although the author is right in saying that once you make that choice you have “enslaved your will to some else’s will.” In the case of someone with the hypothetical psychological condition referred to in the question, a person surrenders responsibility involuntarily, because that person would be incapable of making the decision whether to be responsible or abdicate responsibility; nonetheless, that person surrenders it.</li>
    <li>This hypothetical case would not challenge the author’s position that other people matter, because all that would matter for a person with this psychological condition would be not breaking promises. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 68</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This theme runs throughout the passage. The author states: “You cannot hand over your autonomy willy-nilly to . . . the government or any one else.” The author also states: “No government, no body of people, no position, no individual can have moral authority over any individual.” The author also points out that “the final arbiter is the individual,” even if the government has good reason to require a particular behavior.</li>
    <li>The author consistently argues against this position: “Since someone has to decide what is the right thing for me to do, it may as well be me. In fact, morally, it has to be.” See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>Even in this case the individual is the final moral arbiter and the responsible individual will take into account the effect on others in deciding whether conformity is a good thing: “. . . the fact that frequently in social situations order is beneficial, that makes conformity commendable, not the fact that the government requires it.”</li>
    <li>The author, while conceding that all people are fallible, asserts that, even when consulting experts, the final decision belongs to the individual.</li>

  <summary>Question 69</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This hypothetical finding does not raise the issue of conflicting opinions from experts, only the issue of the correctness of final decisions and how the individual must respond in a situation where it has been proven public officials make the right decision most of the time.</li>
    <li>This hypothetical finding does not support the idea that, even when a decision is made, the individual must examine it to see if it is right or wrong, but challenges that idea by placing the burden of proof on the individual. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>This hypothetical finding theoretically represents a strong challenge to the assertion that the individual is the final moral arbiter, even if that assertion remains a valid argument, because it greatly increases the individual’s burden of proof and, hence, individual responsibility for decisions.</li>
    <li>This hypothetical finding would give the individual additional motivation to abandon the uncomfortable individual responsibility for decisions, because if decisions by public officials are shown to be the right ones most of the time, then an individual has far less reason to carry this uncomfortable burden. Therefore, it does not logically follow that the hypothetical finding challenges this assertion by the author.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 70</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>Even if people drive on different sides of the road in different countries, the central thesis is unchanged by knowing this. The author already gives the example of driving on the left side of the road; therefore, introducing the example of people driving on the right side of the road in another country neither weakens nor lends further support to the central thesis than is already in the passage. At most this new information is simply a variation on the exact same argument. The decision to drive on the right side of the road in a country where it is the law to do so has the same obvious benefits in that country as it does in a country where it is the law to drive on the right side of the road. A responsible individual would obey the law because of these obvious benefits, not because the government mandates driving on the left side, or right side, of the road.</li>
    <li>While it may seem that this new information is contrary to the thesis of the passage, it does not contradict the thesis of the passage because it shows that it is an arbitrary matter as to what side of the road a given country decides an individual can drive, although the matter becomes no longer arbitrary once the decision is reached. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>Even though the author only offers the example of a country that mandates driving on the left side of the road, the added example of a country that mandates driving on the right side of the road represents only a variation on the exact same argument and therefore does not require modification of the central thesis. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
