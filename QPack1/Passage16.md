# Passage 16
It is widely believed that mental phenomena are a special kind of physical phenomena. [Behaviorism] represents one form this opinion can take, holding that mental phenomena are behavioral dispositions or tendencies. In this view, a pain in the big toe consists of a set of dispositions to favor the big toe in certain ways, including the disposition to act in ways that might remove the toe from extremes of temperature or pressure and the disposition to complain about the big toe. Similarly, the belief that it is going to rain consists of dispositions to act as if it was going to rain.

[The analyses suggested by] behaviorism of this simple sort . . . do not work. You may have a pain in your toe without having a disposition to complain or move your toe because you may be a super Spartan who does not want to give any sign of what you are feeling. Many critics would object more controversially that behaviorism takes too external a view of the mental. According to these critics, mental states and processes are not behavioral dispositions; they are the internal states and processes that are responsible for relevant behavioral dispositions.

Now it seems clear that states and processes [of] the brain are responsible for behavioral dispositions. So the only way in which mental states and processes can be responsible for behavioral dispositions is for them to be the very same as the underlying physical states and processes that are responsible for those behavioral dispositions. . . . If pain equals what is responsible for pain behavior and (to oversimplify matters) the firing of C‑fibers equals what is responsible for pain behavior, then pain equals the firing of C‑fibers.

A type-type identity theory holds that every type of mental [experience], such as pain, is identical to a corresponding type of physical [event], such as the firing of C-fibers. It is controversial whether this is an overly strong thesis because of its implication that the physical basis for any type of mental [experience] must be the same in different creatures. A [weak form of] functionalism allows that pain might be the firing of C-fibers in people and a different event in other creatures. Functionalism holds that mental events of a certain sort are to be identified as those underlying events, whatever they are, that function in the relevant way. . . . According to functionalism, it does not matter what mental states and processes are made of, any more than it matters what a carburetor or heart or chess king is made of. . . .

An important aspect of functional notions is that they are defined in relation to a whole system of interdependent functions. To understand . . . a heart . . . you have to understand its function as a pump, which requires understanding . . . the function of the circulation of blood . . . in relation to other functional processes. . . . Similarly, to understand [the way] beliefs function, you have to understand [the way] beliefs function in relation to desires, intentions, perception, emotion, and inference. . . .

This is one reason [that] crude behaviorism must fail. A particular belief taken by itself cannot be identified with particular behavioral dispositions because the relevant behavioral dispositions are determined by various beliefs taken together plus various desires and other mental states. Whether you are disposed to take your umbrella with you depends not just on your belief that it will rain but also your desire not to get wet, your perception of the umbrella in the corner, your further belief that umbrellas are good for keeping rain off, and so on.

# Questions
### 91. The passage suggests that behaviorism and type-type identity theory share which of the following weaknesses?
<ol type="A">
  <li>They oversimplify mental states by reducing them to physiological states.</li>
  <li>They provide no reason for the existence of pain or other mental states.</li>
  <li>They ignore the context provided by associated beliefs and feelings.</li>
  <li>They assume that all mental events are determined by external physical events.</li>
</ol>

### 92. In 1979, opioid peptides, which produce pain relief in humans, were found in earthworms. According to passage information, someone who argues on the basis of this evidence that earthworms may be capable of feeling pain is most likely to be a:
<ol type="A">
  <li>behaviorist.</li>
  <li>type-type identity theorist.</li>
  <li>functionalist.</li>
  <li>nonscientist.</li>
</ol>

### 93. The author apparently believes that “crude behaviorism”:
<ol type="A">
  <li>does not take internal context sufficiently into account.</li>
  <li>should be replaced by type-type identity theory.</li>
  <li>can explain only actions that are predictable.</li>
  <li>assumes that beliefs and feelings do not exist.</li>
</ol>

### 94. Suppose that a mountain climber is offered a replacement for the rope by which the climber is suspended. If the climber accepts the replacement rope, with which of the following conclusions about this acceptance would the author be LEAST apt to agree?
<ol type="A">
  <li>It constitutes evidence of a belief in the weakness of the original rope.</li>
  <li>It is one of many possible results of a belief in the weakness of the original rope.</li>
  <li>It is probably influenced by beliefs other than a belief in the weakness of the original rope.</li>
  <li>It indicates the operation of brain processes associated with changing ropes while climbing.</li>
</ol>

### 95. If asked, most adults would affirm that giraffes do not wear hats in the wild. Such beliefs are apparently constructed from relevant general knowledge rather than stored as explicit information. Is the conclusion that certain beliefs are only implicit consistent with functionalism as the author explains it?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes, because implicit beliefs come into existence when there is a need for them</li>
  <li>Yes, because implicit beliefs are underlying physical events rather than dispositions to behave</li>
  <li>No, because implicit beliefs are irrelevant to desires, intentions, perceptions, and feelings</li>
  <li>No, because implicit beliefs have no function</li>
</ol>

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 91</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This is only true of type-type identity theory, which “holds that every type of mental experience, such as pain, is identical to a corresponding type of physical event, such as the firing of C-fibers.”</li>
    <li>Type-type identity theory explains pain as the firing of C-fibers. Behaviorism explains mental states as being created by external events, for example, “the belief that it is going to rain consists of dispositions to act as if it was going to rain.” The author criticizes this view as being limited to a belief taken in isolation and failing to provide a context: “Whether you are disposed to take your umbrella with you depends not just on your belief that it will rain but also your desire not to get wet, your perception of the umbrella in the corner, your further belief that umbrellas are good for keeping rain off, and so on.”</li>
    <li>The passage indicates that behaviorism does not take into account other factors: “You may have a pain in your toe without having a disposition to complain or move your toe because you may be a super Spartan who does not want to give any sign of what you are feeling.” This statement reflects the author’s view that behavior in relation to the toe is governed by its context, namely, the beliefs associated with not wanting to give the impression of being in pain. The type-type identity theory holds that mental experiences have corresponding physical events. The passage notes that this theory is controversial “because of its implication that the physical basis for any type of mental experience must be the same in different creatures,” which ignores the different contexts for the mental life of different creatures.</li>
    <li>This is only true of behaviorism.</li>

  <summary>Question 92</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A behavioralist would look for behavior in earthworms that acts in ways to remove themselves from the pain.</li>
    <li>The passage points out that one implication of type-type identity theory is “that the physical basis for any type of mental experience must be the same in different creatures.” Therefore, the assumption can be made that, if opioid peptides relieve pain in humans, then earthworms must feel pain in order to need the pain relief provided by opioid peptides.</li>
    <li>A functionalist would look for a greater context for why opioid peptides occur in earthworms, including their “whole system of interdependent functions” as earthworms, which suggests that opioid peptides may occur in earthworms for quite different reasons than they occur in humans</li>
    <li>This assumes that a nonscientist will have the expertise to isolate opioid peptides in humans and earthworms, know how they function and why, and be interested in looking into the occurrence of these in humans and earthworms, none of which is likely.</li>

  <summary>Question 93</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author reflects concern that “crude behavioralism” does not take context into account: “A particular belief taken by itself cannot be identified with particular behavioral dispositions because the relevant behavioral dispositions are determined by various beliefs taken together plus various desires and other mental states.”</li>
    <li>The author does not believe this, and notes that type-type identity theory has a similar problem to behavioralism—it is too reductive in its outlook.</li>
    <li>The author would not make this point and, arguably, would not believe any action is predictable, but is governed by context, which is variable. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The author does not make this assumption. Earlier in the passage the author implicitly acknowledges that behavioralism assumes the existence of beliefs and feelings, since the author uses one example of behavioralism based on response to pain and another example of behavioralism based on response to a belief.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 94</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author would disagree with this conclusion because it is too reductive, representing the type of conclusion a behavioralist would reach. The author rejects this type of conclusion in the example of the umbrella: “Whether you are disposed to take your umbrella with you depends not just on your belief that it will rain but also your desire not to get wet, your perception of the umbrella in the corner, your further belief that umbrellas are good for keeping rain off, and so on.”</li>
    <li>The author would likely accept this conclusion, based on how it takes into account the way “beliefs function in relation to desires, intentions, perceptions, emotions and inference.”</li>
    <li>The author would be more likely to agree with this conclusion since it takes into account other beliefs that may not result in such obvious external outcomes, which according to critics, behavioralism fails to account for.</li>
    <li>The author would be more likely to agree with this conclusion, since it reflects a view that several associated brain processes are at work here. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 95</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author explains: “Functionalism holds that mental events of a certain sort are to be identified as those underlying events, whatever they are, that function in a relevant way.” The affirmation that giraffes do not wear hats in the wild is an example of a mental event based on the underlying event of general knowledge functioning in a relevant way.</li>
    <li>Implicit beliefs are mental events, not physical events. Type-type identity theory, <i>not</i> functionalism, would hold that they are physical events.</li>
    <li>Functionalism sees beliefs as relevant: “. . . to understand the way beliefs function, you have to understand the way beliefs function in relation to desires, intentions, perceptions, emotions and inference.”</li>
    <li>Functionalism holds that beliefs are one of the functional processes. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
