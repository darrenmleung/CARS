# Passage 13
The institutions of the state generate a civil religion; so do the institutions of sport. The ancient Olympic games used to be both festivals in honor of the gods and festivals in honor of the state—and that has been the classical position of sports ever since. The ceremonies of sports overlap those of the state on one side and those of [religion] on the other. At the Super Bowl in 1970, clouds of military jets flew in formation, [U.S.] flags and patriotic bunting flapped in the wind, ceremonies honored prisoners of war, [clergy] solemnly prayed, thousands sang the national anthem. Going to a stadium is half like going to a political rally, half like going to [a religious gathering]. Even today, the Olympics are constructed around high ceremonies, rituals, and symbols. The Olympics are not bare-bones athletic events but religion and politics as well.

Most men and women don’t separate the sections of their mind. They honor their country, go to [a place of worship], and also enjoy sports. All parts of their lives meld together. [Nearly] every writer about sports lapses into watery religious metaphor. So do writers on politics and sex. Larry Merchant says television treated the Super Bowl “as though it were a solemn High Mass.” Words like *sacred, devotion, faith, ritual, immortality,* and *love* figure often in the language of sports. Cries like “You gotta believe!” and “life or death” and “sacrifice” are frequently heard. . . .

I am arguing a considerably stronger point. I am saying that sports flow outward into action from a deep natural impulse that is radically religious: an impulse of freedom, respect for ritual limits, a zest for symbolic meaning, and a longing for perfection. The athlete may of course be pagan, but sports are, as it were, natural religions. There are many ways to express this radical impulse: by the asceticism and dedication of preparation; by a sense of respect for the mysteries of one’s own body and soul and for powers not in one’s own control; by a sense of awe for the place and time of competition; by a sense of fate; by a felt sense of comradeship and destiny; by a sense of participation in the rhythms and tides of nature itself.

Sports, in the second place, are organized and dramatized in a religious way. Not only do the origins of sports, like the origins of drama, lie in religious celebrations; not only are the rituals, vestments, and tremor of anticipation involved in sports events like those of religions—even in our own secular age and for quite sophisticated and agnostic persons, the rituals of sports really work. They do serve a religious function: They feed a deep human hunger, place humans in touch with certain dimly perceived features of human life within this cosmos, and provide an experience of at least a pagan sense of godliness.

Among the godward signs in contemporary life, sports may be the single most powerful manifestation. I don’t mean that participation in sports, as athlete or fan, makes one a believer in “God,” under whatever concept, image, experience, or drive to which one attaches the name. Rather, sports drive one in some dark and generic sense “godward.” In the language of Paul Tillich, sports are manifestations of concern, of will and intellect and passion. In fidelity to that concern, one submits oneself to great bodily dangers, even to the danger of death. Symbolically, too, to lose is a kind of death.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 76</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author makes several statements that emphasize this point: “The institutions of the state generate a civil religion; so do the institutions of sport.” The author then cites the example of the ancient and modern Olympics and the Super Bowl, which to varying degrees honor the gods and the state and “are constructed around high ceremonies, rituals, and symbols.” The author later reinforces this point: “Sports . . . are organized and dramatized in a religious way.” The author elaborates on this theme in a way that underscores this profound importance of sports in public life: “. . . sports flow outward into action from a deep natural impulse that is radically religious: an impulse of freedom, respect for ritual limits, a zest for symbolic meaning, and a longing for perfection.”</li>
    <li>While the religious history of sports plays into the passage argument in the way the author discusses the ancient Olympics, this religious history does not represent the main point but only supports it. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The patriotic impulses in sports to which the author refers do not represent the main point of the passage but only support it. These impulses are but one dimension in the larger significance that sports takes on in public life, as the author points out: “Most men and women don’t separate the sections of their mind. They honor their country, go to a place of worship, and also enjoy sports. All parts of their lives meld together.”</li>
    <li>The author does not make this distinction but, instead, implies that the ceremony and the excitement and drama of sports represent one part of the whole: “Sports . . . are organized and dramatized in a religious way.”</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 77</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author takes care to distinguish ‘godward’ from the narrower sense of a divine presence, in particular, pointing out: “I don’t mean that participation in sports, as athlete or fan, makes one a believer in ‘God,’ under whatever concept, image, experience, or drive to which one attaches the name.”</li>
    <li>The author uses this word in the more generic sense of explaining the religious impulses in sports: “Among the godward signs in contemporary life, sports may be the single most powerful manifestation. I don’t mean that participation in sports, as athlete or fan, makes one a believer in ‘God,’ under whatever concept, image, experience, or drive to which one attaches the name. Rather, sports drive one in some dark and generic sense ‘godward.’”</li>
    <li>Popular spiritual movements, or their relationship to conventional religions, are not even discussed in the passage. The author does discuss some of the ways sports takes on the qualities of conventional religion, for example, pointing out how “the rituals, vestments, and tremor of anticipation involved in sports events are like those of religions.”</li>
    <li>The author never implies that interest in sports will lead to a religious revival, only that contemporary sports incorporate the qualities of religious observances. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 78</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not suggest that athletes are necessarily devout or patriotic, even suggesting otherwise: “The athlete may of course be pagan, but sports are, as it were, natural religions.”</li>
    <li>The author does not use the term “classical position” in reference to the skills of ancient Greek athletes, nor even allude to their skills anywhere in the passage. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>The author traces the contemporary phenomenon of sports as a kind of civil religion back to the ancient Greeks. Therefore, the author uses this terminology in the sense of recognizing this on-going function of sports in public life: “The ancient Olympic games used to be both festivals in honor of the gods and festivals in honor of the state—and that has been the <i>classical position</i> of sports ever since” (<i>italics added</i>).</li>
    <li>The author neither rejects nor accepts the domination of athletics by religion and politics by using this terminology. The author simply uses it more objectively in order to show how the relationship between sports, politics, and religion is a long-standing historical fact that extends into the present. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 79</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Even if this were true, this would only make a statement about people’s preferences and would have no significant impact on the author’s argument that sporting events take on religious qualities. This would even, in a sense, support the argument, because one explanation for why more people would attend religious ceremonies could be that the conventionally religious would find their particular God in the religious ceremonies that they attend rather than in sporting events, which, as the author contends, take on a religious character without expressing a particular religious faith.</li>
    <li>Just because sports fans fail to recognize it does not necessarily mean it is not there—and perhaps they would recognize their religious impulse once the author brought it to their attention.</li>
    <li>The author makes the point that sports take on a religious character, driving one “godward” no matter what one’s belief in God may be. If it were true that only the conventionally religious tended to enjoy the spiritual dimension of sports, the author would need to substantially revise this analysis.</li>
    <li>This would not be relevant to the argument, since the feelings of athletes in relation to the feelings of fans in a sport is a matter separate from the matter of the religious dimension of sports.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 80</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author makes this statement in the context of discussing the extent of the emotional investment in sports: “In the language of Paul Tillich, sports are manifestations of concern, of will and intellect and passion. In fidelity to that concern, one submits oneself to great bodily dangers, even to the danger of death. Symbolically, too, to lose is a kind of death.”</li>
    <li>Honoring losers as well as winners does not enter into the passage discussion at all, much less in reference to this particular point.</li>
    <li>The author, in a sense, makes a case for the <i>acceptability</i> of losing here, by implying that losing, like death, is part of the order of things, a point made earlier in the passage when the author refers to how sports express a larger order of things that includes fate, destiny, and “a sense of participation in the rhythms and tides of nature itself.” The author implies that one who participates in sports submits oneself to losing the way one submits “to great bodily dangers, even to the danger of death.” In other words, one accepts that one may not only lose, but die trying.</li>
    <li>While the inference could be made that the religious dimension of sports represents evidence of an exaggerated concern with sports, this inference would be external to the passage argument, since the author nowhere states or implies an exaggerated concern with sports. The author suggests otherwise, that concern for sports is not exaggerated but represents a deeply human experience: “They feed a deep human hunger, place humans in touch with certain dimly perceived features of human life within this cosmos, and provide an experience of at least a pagan sense of godliness.”</li>
