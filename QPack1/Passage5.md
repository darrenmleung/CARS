# Passage 5
Literary historians tell two stories about the novel in America before the Civil War. First, the Puritan tradition, enhanced by Scottish common sense philosophy, created an atmosphere hostile to fiction. Second, the sparseness of American social life made conventional novels difficult, even impossible, to write. These two narrative strands led to a single conclusion. The would-be American novelist before the Civil War was drawn, or forced, toward a literary form better suited to American imaginative space: the romance, created in an ambience of isolation, alienation, defiance, and apology that left its traces in the work.

This powerful critical myth, which at least since the 1950s has controlled our understanding of the novel in America, does not hold up well under empirical investigation. For one thing, expressed hostility to fiction was no less strong in England than in America; much of what Americans wrote and said about novels was derived from sources written in the British Isles. Scottish common sense philosophy should not be described as an American phenomenon. Second, the “conventional” novel at that time was only in the process of becoming conventional. Third, a great many novels were written and published in America at this time of supposed hostility to fiction, and a great many more were being read.

Book reviews published between 1840 and 1860 in major American periodicals offer evidence of American readers’ interest in fiction. In the 1840s, the periodical press in America came into its own. There were fewer than 125 American magazines in 1825; by 1850 there were about 600, with most of the expansion occurring in the 1840s. Many of these magazines were local or specialized in their appeal, but a few dozen, by virtue of their circulation, influence, or national scope, are properly called “major.” Some journals passed the 100,000 subscriber mark in the 1850s (a number that would extrapolate to over a million today), including *Harper’s*, *Godey’s*, *Peterson’s*, and the *Ledger*, while Horace Greeley’s *Tribunein* the aggregate of daily and weekly editions surpassed 200,000 in 1858.

A survey of 21 major American periodicals published during all or part of this period, including the five mentioned above, reveals more than two thousand reviews of eight hundred separate novels, about half of them American in origin. The reviews ranged in length from a single sentence in an omnibus review article to articles of many pages devoted to a single book. More often than not, American novels were received warmly by reviewers; in fact, those on magazine staffs who set themselves up as guardians of critical integrity complained about indiscriminate puffery among reviewers rather than the opposite. Of course a review does not necessarily represent the notions of anybody except its author, and even many congruent reviews may express only the opinions of a particular group of interested people. But perusing reviews from this period reveals that novel reviewing was conducted in constant awareness of what people were reading, and was directed toward trying to understand the reasons for public preferences. The reviews offer guidance and correction in a way that suggests reviewers had a fairly precise idea of what they were guiding and correcting.

The small number of American fiction writers who are now called major did, evidently, have trouble supporting themselves as novelists. But the explanation for this difficulty cannot be hostility in the public at large to fiction in general. The America into which Hawthorne launched *The Scarlet Letter* and Melville launched *Moby Dick* was a nation of novel readers.

  <summary>Question 29</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author makes a key point about the expansion of the number of journals during this period and how these journals ran two thousand reviews of eight hundred novels, around half of them of U.S. origin, in order to show the great public interest in novels by U.S. authors. Therefore, it only follows that the number of American novels being read would be even more impressive, given that publishers in the U.S. could profit more by publishing European novels.</li>
    <li>The author does not raise the issue of literary nationalism or hold this view. The statistic that half the novels were American only serves to show that many novels were being written in the U.S. as well as Europe and that the U.S. public was interested in reading them. It is not presented as evidence concerning literary nationalism or whether or not it was a viable force. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>It would more logically follow in this case that publishers were as interested if not more interested in responding to the interest of the U.S. reading public as in making a profit. Otherwise, they would be more inclined to promote European novels over American. This only reinforces the author’s point that the U.S. “was a nation of novel readers” rather than showing publishers were only interested in a profit. </li>
    <li>On the contrary, this would show that publishers were interested in responding to the public’s interest in novels, especially American novels, since they could make more profit on European novels. See <i>rationales A and C.</i></li>

  <summary>Question 30</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author states: “The small number of American fiction writers who are now called major did, evidently, have trouble supporting themselves as novelists.” However, the author does not present the evidence and leaves this as a simple assertion.</li>
    <li>The author supports this by citing the actual number of reviews of novels and the number of novels reviewed during this period, two thousand and eight hundred respectively.</li>
    <li>The author points out how, from perusing reviews during this period, American novels were well-received by reviewers to the point that staff members of magazines were concerned that reviewers were too quick to praise.</li>
    <li>The author provides ample statistics to support this point: “There were fewer than 125 American magazines in 1825; by 1850 there were about 600. . . .” This included a number of journals that had over 100,000 subscribers and Horace Greeley’s <i>Tribune</i> with over 200,000 subscribers.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 31</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>At no point later in the passage is this statement developed further. The statement is designed to counter one the critical myths referred to in the opening paragraph.</li>
    <li>The previous sentence in part reads: “. . . much of what Americans wrote and said about novels was derived from sources in the British Isles.” In the context of the passage argument, the sentence in question is therefore a logical extension of this statement, elaborating on this point by means of specific reference to the origin of Scottish common sense philosophy in the U.S.</li>
    <li>The author never specifically makes the point that hostility to the novel originated abroad, only that “expressed hostility to fiction was no less strong in England than in America,” implying that this could have just as easily been a simultaneous development and that some Americans were simply influenced by what was said and wrote about regarding the novel in England.</li>
    <li>In citing one of the critical myths of literary history, the passage does not suggest that Scottish common sense philosophy <i>itself</i> was openly hostile to fiction, only that it joined with Puritanism to create an atmosphere hostile to fiction, a fine distinction. In addition, when considering its context within the passage, the sentence in question functions not to support this idea but to additionally support the preceding sentence. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 32</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author never explains specifically why the Puritan tradition was hostile to the novel. Therefore, there is no basis for seeing the similarity between that myth and the reasons cited for the death of the novel in the 1950s.</li>
    <li>The breakdown of social cohesiveness and individual isolation are two reasons given for why the romance was prevalent, stating that the romance was “a literary form better suited to American imaginative space: the romance, created in an ambience of isolation, alienation, defiance, and apology that left its traces in the work.”</li>
    <li>The reviews, far from proclaiming the death of the novel, were largely enthusiastic, giving tacit approval to the form and, if anything, giving it new life.</li>
    <li>Beyond implying that Scottish common sense philosophy may have influenced this hostility, the author does not explain the actual reasons behind this hostility, including specifically why Scottish common sense philosophy would contribute to this atmosphere. Therefore, there is no basis for comparing this to the death of the novel theory.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 33</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This would be consistent with the passage argument, which pointed out that novels were being favorably reviewed and that some magazine staff members were concerned about “indiscriminate puffery among reviewers.”</li>
    <li>The author has pointed out that this hostility, one of the critical myths posited by literary historians, largely did not exist: “. . . a great many novels were written and published in America at this time of supposed hostility to fiction, and a great many more were being read.” Therefore, such an editorial would be unlikely, especially since half the novels being read by the reading public in the U.S. were American.</li>
    <li>This would be consistent with the observation in the passage that “much of what Americans wrote and said about novels was derived from sources written in the British Isles.” Given the passage argument, this presumably could include favorable as well as unfavorable opinions about novels. Therefore, it would not be far-fetched to find a favorable review of an American novel copied from a British periodical in an American periodical, especially given a general atmosphere favorably inclined toward novels in which “American novels were received warmly by reviewers.”</li>
    <li>Such an essay could very well appear, especially since the author points out that this philosophy had some influence upon life and thought in the U.S. Another reason such an essay could very well appear would be if reviewers were aware of the influence of this philosophy on opinions concerning the novel and wanted to correct this opinion and offer guidance to readers, which, as the author points out, <i>was</i> one of the roles assumed by reviewers during this period.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 34</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author points out that “American novels were received warmly by reviewers.” So the views on the part of magazine staff represent credible evidence of yet another prevailing attitude at the time as reported by the author, who observes that these staff “complained about indiscriminate puffery among reviewers.”</li>
    <li>The author presents these staff members as <i>evidence</i> of a prevailing attitude rather than as simply “questionable,” and as actual rather than as simply “intriguing possibilities.” See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The author does not pass this judgment on these staff members, who simply reflect an attitude at the time, although the author does point out how reviewers were sensitive to the reading public and offered them guidance.</li>
    <li>The author does not pass this judgment but only sees these staff members as being concerned about the lack of standards among reviewers, and not entirely without cause, given the large number of favorable reviews.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 35</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Option III is also correct. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>Option I is also correct. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The author makes no correlation between the length of the reviews the books received and their popularity, simply stating that reviews were of varying length with many of them highly favorable toward the novels they reviewed.</li>
    <li>The author, even while acknowledging that reviewers and even groups of reviewers were expressing their own opinions in reviewing novels, nonetheless points out that, based on perusing reviews at the time, the reviewers had a fairly precise idea of public preferences and what guidance and correction to this public they were offering. The author also argues that novels were highly popular during this period and many were being written, thus dispelling the critical myth that would-be novelists were writing romances, which were more suited to conditions in the U.S. at the time. It follows, then, that these lists would need to reflect the relative popularity of romances and novels in order to evaluate the accuracy of the passage argument regarding the popularity of novels.</li>
