# Passage 6
Confucius saw that the truly, distinctively human powers have, characteristically, a magical quality. His task, therefore, required, in effect, that he reveal what is already so familiar and universal as to be unnoticed. What is necessary in such cases is that one come upon this “obvious” dimension of our existence in a new way, in the right way. Confucius found the path: we go by way of the notion of *li*.

One has to labor long and hard to learn *li*. The word in its root meaning is close to “holy ritual,” “sacred ceremony.” Characteristic of Confucius's teaching is the use of the language and imagery of *li* as a medium within which to talk about the entire body of the authentic tradition and reasonable conventions of society. Confucius taught that the ability to act according to *li* and the will to submit to *li* are essential to that perfect and peculiarly human virtue or power which can be one's own.

Confucius characteristically and sharply contrasts the ruler who uses *li* with the ruler who seeks to attain ends by means of commands, threats, regulations, punishments and force. The force of coercion is manifest and tangible, whereas the vast (and sacred) forces at work in *li* are invisible and intangible. *Li* works through spontaneous coordination rooted in reverent dignity. The perfection in Holy Rite is esthetic as well as spiritual.

The effortless power of *li* can also be used to accomplish physical ends, though we usually do not think of it this way. Let us suppose I wish to bring a book from my office to my classroom. If I have no magic powers, I must literally take steps – walk to my office, et cetera. But there is also magic – the proper ritual expression of my wish which will accomplish my wish with no such effort on my part. I turn politely, i.e., ceremonially, to one of my students in class and merely express in an appropriate and polite (ritual) formula my wish. In almost no time the book is in my hands, as I wished!

The notion that we can use speech only to talk *about* action or indirectly to *evoke* action has dominated modern Western thought. Yet contemporary “linguistic” analysis in philosophy has revealed increasingly how much the ritual word is itself the critical act rather than a report of, or stimulus to, action. The philosopher J. L. Austin brought the reality and pervasiveness of this phenomenon to a focus in his analyses of what he called the “performative utterance.” These are the innumerable statements we make which function somewhat like the “operative” clause in a legal instrument. They are the very execution of the act itself.

“I give and bequeath my watch to my brother,” duly said or written is not a report of what I have already done but is the very act of bequeathal itself. It is by words, and by the ceremony of which the words form a part, that I bind myself in a way which, for someone “ever turning to *li*,” is more powerful, more inescapable than strategies or force.

The central lesson of Professor Austin's new philosophical insights is not so much a lesson about language as it is about ceremony. What we have come to see, in our own way, is how vast is the area of human existence in which the substance of that existence is the ceremony. Promises, commitments, excuses, pleas, compliments, pacts – these and so much more are ceremonies or they are nothing.

  <summary>Question 36</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Not only are promises, commitments, pleas, and pacts not the focus of the passage; the passage author implicitly deplores the degeneration of such performative utterances from sacred rituals into empty verbal conventions: “these . . . are ceremonies or they are nothing”.</li>
    <li>The effectiveness of <i>li</i> in directing behavior (inducing a student to bring one a book) is mentioned only as an example of its incidental power to accomplish physical ends; it “can also be used” in this way. Furthermore, the willful control of others would be antithetical to the concept of <i>li</i> presented.</li>
    <li>The honesty of performative utterances is not at issue. They are discussed only to provide Western examples of the Eastern idea of binding, ceremonious words.</li>
    <li>The thesis topic is “the truly, distinctively human powers” considered by Confucius. The central thesis about these powers is that they must be approached “by way of the notion of <i>li</i>”, the meaning of which “is close to ‘holy ritual,’ ‘sacred ceremony’”. This thesis is elaborated throughout the passage.</li>

  <summary>Question 37</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The idea that unlike coercion, which violates the dignity of others, “<i>li</i> works through spontaneous coordination rooted in reverent dignity” is traced to Confucius.</li>
    <li>The powers that are distinctively human have “a magical quality”. Implicitly, these powers are the “invisible and intangible” forces of <i>li</i>: Through ceremonious politeness, one may experience the “magic” of having one’s wishes met. That is, <i>li</i> is magical figuratively in its results, not <i>li</i>terally in its means. It is “rooted in reverent dignity”, not in the occult.</li>
    <li>The idea that the practice of <i>li</i> does not involve effort is presented as an aspect of its magical quality, not as a reason for its use.</li>
    <li>The passage does not suggest that risk avoidance is a valid reason to strive for “the perfection in Holy Rite”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 38</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The adjective magical refers to powers “so familiar and universal as to be unnoticed”. This context, as well as that in which the noun <i>magic</i> later appears, expresses a sense of wonder at the effectiveness of conventional social forms: The only action taken is “the proper ritual expression of my wish,” yet the wish is accomplished without “effort on my part”. The magical quality of such transactions is emphasized by the phrases “merely express . . . my wish” and “in almost no time” as well as by an exclamation point.</li>
    <li>There is no suggestion that the revelations of Confucius concerned supernatural methods. The dimension of human existence to which the word <i>magical</i> is applied is unnoticed only because it is “already so familiar and universal”.</li>
    <li>The occult is not invoked, and although “one has to labor long and hard to learn <i>li</i>”, there is no suggestion that the services of a master are required. The difficulty in acquiring “the ability to act according to <i>li</i> and the will to submit to <i>li</i>” is not that the concept is difficult to understand but that its perfection “is esthetic as well as spiritual”.</li>
    <li>The moving of objects by means of words is presented as an incidental aspect of <i>li</i>: It “can also be used to accomplish physical ends, although we usually do not think of it this way”. Furthermore, in the example of a book that appears without being actively sought by the author, the words do not act on the desired object but on “one of my students”, who willingly delivers it.</li>

<details>
  <summary>Question 39</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A request (<i>option I</i>) does not constitute the performance of an act by the speaker. Rather, it is a “stimulus to” action by another.</li>
    <li><i>Option II</i> is a performative utterance because to utter the words “I promise” is to commit oneself through one’s words. The utterance is “the very execution of the act [of commitment] itself”, in the same way as “‘I give and bequeath my watch’ . . . is not a report of what I have already done but is the very act of bequeathal”.</li>
    <li>A question (<i>option III</i>) does not constitute the performance of an act by the speaker. Rather, it is a “stimulus to” action by another–that of replying.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 40</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The adjective <i>holy</i> refers to ritual, the concept in which the Confucian term <i>li</i> originated, indicating that Confucius revered tradition. In the discussion of the teachings of Confucius, the description of conventions as “authentic” and “reasonable”, the association of <i>li</i> with “reverent dignity”, and the contrast drawn between the user of <i>li</i> and one who uses coercive means further imply that for Confucius, the holiness of ceremonies derived from the respect for self, for others, and for tradition that they express.</li>
    <li>The passage does not suggest that Confucius believed in the existence of a divine lawgiver capable of sanctioning social conventions.</li>
    <li>The ceremonies extolled by Confucius conveyed “distinctively human powers”. They were not the ephemeral customs of a privileged class but a “familiar and universal . . . dimension of [human] existence”.</li>
    <li>Although “one has to labor long and hard to learn <i>li</i>, and although without <i>li</i>, one cannot possess “that perfect and peculiarly human virtue or power”, there is no suggestion that only holy persons succeed in learning to perform social ceremonies or that persons who practice holy rites become holy themselves.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 41</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Austin’s idea is that language sometimes is the action to which it refers.</li>
    <li>Although performative utterances may sometimes be intended to conceal facts–e.g., a false declaration made under oath–this use of language is not implicit in the concept.</li>
    <li>Austin’s idea, that “innumerable statements . . . are the very execution of the act itself” means that in declarations in which the verb refers to one’s own current linguist act (I admit . . ., I assure you . . ., I name you . . .), language is inseparable from the action being taken.</li>
    <li>The idea that social conventions involve ritual words (but not that they require them) is implicit in the passage. However, this idea is not implied by the concept of performative utterances, which refers to particular forms of ceremonial speech, not to social conventions in general.</li>
