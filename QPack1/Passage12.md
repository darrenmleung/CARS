# Passage 12
A phenomenon such as “female fiction” does not exist, but in the 1960s there began to appear novels about the “female experience” by both male and female writers. It is necessary to separate these books from anything called “female fiction,” which would suggest that the culture bifurcates into two distinct experiences, one male and one female. That such experiences differ, there can be no disagreement; but that such experiences overlap, there should also be no disagreement. I concur with Elaine Showalter’s statement:

> Women writers should not be studied as a distinct group on the assumption that they write alike, or even display stylistic resemblances distinctively feminine. But women do have a special literary history susceptible to analysis, which includes such complex considerations as the economics of their relation to the literary marketplace, the effects of social and political changes in women’s status upon individuals, and the implications of stereotypes of the woman writer and restrictions of her artistic autonomy.

There is by now a sizable body of fiction that focuses on female experiences or conditions, in which women must find their way personally, professionally, socially, in what is basically a patriarchy. This term we may define as any society in which men control authority and determine the roles women should or should not play.

An example of the female imagination at work comes in the following way. In *Jane Eyre*, Bertha, the “madwoman in the attic,” is presented as the element that must be eliminated in order for Rochester and Jane to complete their destiny together. Imprisoned in the upper reaches of Thornfield, she is a threat to foreground order and stability, a principle of chaos, in fact. Since Charlotte Brontë was writing a romance, Bertha could become expendable.

In a society more oriented to the overall female experience, Jean Rhys in *Wide Sargasso Sea* perceived in Bertha the characteristic victim of a male-dominated society, a woman moved around as an object, living out others’ sense of her experience, not her own, and becoming mad as the sole way of breaking through an unyielding situation. In this view, Bertha’s plight is more archetypically female than Jane’s, by far, since Jane is moving in a fairy tale of sorts in which elements yield to her, whereas Bertha has moved in the real world of power. There is, I feel, no male novelist who could have picked up the thread of Bertha’s existence and turned it into an emblem, as Jean Rhys did; and here alone we note the way the female novelist can perceive aspects of experience that remain (at least in our era) outside the reach of the male writer. Reading back from Rhys, we experience *Jane Eyre* differently.

More recently, Virginia Woolf has become a powerful influence in analyses of the female experience by U.S. writers. Not only her fiction and literary essays but a book such as *A Room of One’s Own* (1929) have served to reinforce what many women writers were already saying. Woolf offered, also, something of an aesthetic, in that she asserted women had to develop a prose of their own. After mentioning Newman, Sterne, Dickens, Thackeray, among others, she says: “The weight, the pace, the stride of a man’s mind are too unlike her own.” She quotes a typical early-nineteenth-century sentence and adds: “That was a man’s sentence; behind it one can see Johnson, Gibbon, and the rest. It was unsuited for a woman’s use.” She sums up: “There is no reason to think that the form of the epic or of the poetic play suits a woman any more than the sentence suits her. But all the older forms of literature were hardened and set by the time she became a writer. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands.”

  <summary>Question 71</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author refrains from such absolutes by indicating there is overlap between male and female experiences. See rationale B.</li>
    <li>The following statement emphasizes that there is a degree of similarity between male and female experience, even in the face of differences: “That such experiences [male and female] differ, there can be no disagreement; but that such experiences overlap, there should also be no disagreement.”</li>
    <li>The passage author does not resort to such value judgments, instead discussing in descriptive terms how male and female experience differs, for example, discussing how women must function in a patriarchy.</li>
    <li>The passage author indicates that the opposite seems true in the discussion. Male experience has an influence over female experience, both in discussing patriarchy and in discussing how Rhys viewed the character Bertha controlled by the character Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i> as “a woman [who was] moved around as an object, living out others’ sense of her experience, not her own, and becoming mad as the sole way of breaking through an unyielding situation.”</li>

  <summary>Question 72</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The main theme of the passage is the struggle of women for identity in a patriarchy: “There is by now a sizable body of fiction that focuses on female experiences or conditions, in which women must find their way personally, professionally, socially, in what is basically a patriarchy. This term we may define as any society in which men control authority and determine the roles women should or should not play.” This theme is augmented by the passage discussion of how Bertha in <i>Jane Eyre</i> represents “the characteristic victim of a male-dominated society.” It is further augmented by the passage author’s reference to Virginia Woolfe’s discussion of how certain of the older generic and stylistic forms of writing are unsuited to women and how the novel was new enough to be amenable to women’s use.</li>
    <li>The passage author’s agreement with Showalter dispels the notion that the passage author supports the idea of a distinctly feminine prose style. The passage author quotes Showalter: “Women writers should not be studied as a distinct group on the assumption that they write alike, or even display stylistic resemblances distinctively feminine.”</li>
    <li>The passage author emphasizes how female characters are presented from a female point of view, even in the case of Charlotte Brontë, whose <i>Jane Eyre</i> exemplifies “the female imagination at work” in her portrayal of Bertha.</li>
    <li>The passage author does not generally discuss female characters as emblems but only makes a specific reference to how Rhys sees Bertha in <i>Jane Eyre</i> as an emblem of female experience.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 73</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author reinforces this point with the following comment: “There is, I feel, no male novelist who could have picked up the thread of Bertha’s existence and turned it into an emblem, as Jean Rhys did; and here alone we note the way the female novelist can perceive aspects of experience that remain (at least in our era) outside the reach of the male writer. Reading back from Rhys, we experience <i>Jane Eyre</i> differently.”</li>
    <li>The passage author discusses how the character Bertha is reworked, but not in the form of an adaptation of an older form of literature. The author then goes on to make the opposite point of how Virginia Woolfe asserted that women actually avoided “hardened” older forms of literature such as the epic or poetic play in favor of a relatively more recent form, the novel.</li>
    <li>In quoting Showalter, the passage author rejects the notion of a distinctively feminine prose style.</li>
    <li>Rather than a misunderstanding of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the passage author asserts that Jean Rhys presents a new understanding of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. See rationale A.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 74</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author contradicts this view: “There is . . . no male novelist who could have picked up the thread of Bertha’s existence and turned it into an emblem as Jean Rhys did.”</li>
    <li>Option I is not the correct answer. See rationale A.</li>
    <li>Option I is not the correct answer. See rationale A.</li>
    <li>The passage author comments that, according to Rhys’s view, “Bertha’s plight is more archetypically female than Jane’s, by far, because Jane is moving in a fairy tale of sorts in which elements yield to her, whereas Bertha has moved in the real world of power.” Bertha also functions as a plot device and “is presented as the element that must be eliminated in order for Rochester and Jane to complete their destiny together.” The passage author goes on to suggest that this was determined by the genre: “Because Charlotte Bronte was writing a romance, Bertha could become expendable.”</li>

<details>
<summary>Question 75</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author refers to Virginia Woolfe’s discussion <i>in A Room of One’s Own</i> of the suitability for women of certain sentences written by men along with older literary forms such as the epic and poetic play. The author quotes Virginia Woolfe as follows: “[A]ll the older forms of literature were hardened and set by the time she became a writer. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands.”</li>
    <li>Virginia Woolfe never makes this point as quoted by the passage author.</li>
    <li>The Virginia Woolfe quotation places the epic and the poetic play among the older forms of literature. See rationale A.</li>
    <li>Virginia Woolfe discusses, as an issue separate from older forms such as the epic or poetic play, how women need to develop a prose of their own because a man’s mind is too much unlike a woman’s. She uses the example of a sentence that was a man’s sentence, unsuited for women’s use.</li>
