# Passage 20
Available research in second-language study strongly supports the hypothesis that the processes Krashen and others have called acquisition (the unconscious formulation of grammatical principles) and learning (the conscious cognitive-based study of grammar) represent two systems for internalizing knowledge about language. . . . [Activities] promoting acquisition are indispensable for all students. Learning activities are more limited in their usefulness to beginners. . . .

Overwhelming research evidence and informal reports point out that students who wish to communicate must acquire this ability in much the same way that speakers, adults or children, acquire it in natural situations. Krashen provides strong evidence that learned, rather than acquired, rules are of limited use to the student; for some, they serve as a monitor—i.e., primarily an “editor” to make minor changes or corrections in utterances which for the most part are initiated by acquired knowledge. Research supports Krashen’s hypothesis that this monitor can be activated only under restricted circumstances. The speakers must: (1) know the rule; (2) be focused on the form of what they are saying; and (3) have time to apply the rule.

Most speakers meet conditions for monitoring regularly and systematically only on cognitive grammar tests. Most of us are not able to monitor to an appreciable degree in normal communicative situations. Thus, even if rules are learned by students through explanation, drill, and practice, and even if they demonstrate that they can produce correct forms and syntax on grammar exams, such (cognitively based) knowledge is usually not very helpful in normal communicative situations, particularly in the beginning stages. Krashen’s monitor theory thus explains that oral proficiency in communication is not necessarily related to the ability to achieve high scores on standard grammar tests, a fact usually overlooked by language teachers who claim to have communicative competence as a goal but continue to evaluate progress only in the learning of grammar rules.

Krashen claims that the monitor theory also accounts for the tremendous variation in grammatical accuracy among adults. There are “underusers,” those who rarely use their learned competence or perhaps those whose learned competence is low. (“Underusers” might still achieve very high levels of communicative accuracy entirely through acquisition.) “Overusers” spend so much time and effort on correctness that it often seriously interferes with communication. “Optimal users” are those who are able to monitor their speech and improve their level of grammatical accuracy, but not to such an extent that it interferes with smooth communication.

A fourth category was suggested by Carlos Yorio . . . “superusers,” those who are consciously able to apply learned rules quickly and efficiently so that a listener would not notice the monitoring at all. Many language instructors fall into this category, and although most have acquired the relevant rules through subsequent experience and no longer need to monitor their speech consciously, they often feel that this mode of production (supermonitoring) is the most efficient way to learn another language. Unfortunately, many, perhaps most, students are not capable of performing with the mental gymnastics of their supermonitor instructors. . . .

Fortunately, a conscious understanding of grammar rules is not a prerequisite to their acquisition. Most adults are not very good at learning grammar, but they acquire rules readily, although usually imperfectly, given the chance to interact in communicative situations with native speakers of the target language.

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 111</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>While “underusers” may have low levels of learned competence, learned rules are not useful to them, since “underusers” could “still achieve very high levels of communicative accuracy through acquisition.” The only situation in which learned rules would be useful to “underusers” is when they are taking a grammar test—see <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>The author points out that learned rules are “not very helpful in normal communicative situations, particularly in the beginning stages.” Monitor theory holds that acquired rather than learned rules are more useful to second-language students.</li>
    <li>In explaining the monitor theory, the author notes: “Krashen’s monitor theory thus explains that oral proficiency in communication is not necessarily related to the ability to achieve high scores on standard grammar tests. . . .” Therefore, it follows that learned rules would be most useful when students are taking a grammar test.</li>
    <li>The author points out that most people cannot monitor learned rules in normal communication and that learned rules can actually interfere with oral communication.</li>

  <summary>Question 112</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>“Superusers” do not fall so precisely into this category—they “are consciously able to apply learned rules quickly and efficiently so that a listener would not notice the monitoring at all.” The proficiency of “superusers” is what distinguishes them from “overusers” who reduce language proficiency by overemphasizing correctness.</li>
    <li>The author points out how “overusers” put too much emphasis on this: “‘Overusers’ spend so much time and effort on correctness that it often seriously interferes with communication.”</li>
    <li> “Optimal users” find a proper balance by monitoring their speech only enough to improve their grammar but not so much that it interferes with their ability to communicate smoothly.</li>
    <li> “Underusers . . . rarely use their learned competence [but] might still achieve very high levels of communicative accuracy through acquisition.”</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 113</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Monitor theory asserts that there is little relationship between good performances on grammar tests and oral proficiency. Therefore, this finding would represent a strong challenge to monitor theory.</li>
    <li>In explaining the monitor theory, the author notes: “Krashen’s monitor theory thus explains that oral proficiency in communication is not necessarily related to the ability to achieve high scores on standard grammar tests. . . .” Therefore, it follows that learned rules would be most useful when students are taking a grammar test.</li>
    <li>This would prove far less troublesome to monitor theory since this exception is explained by the fact that many language instructors tend to be “superusers” who are able to use knowledge of grammar rules to improve oral proficiency.</li>
    <li>This would still be consistent with monitor theory in the case of those language instructors who are not “superusers.” See <i>rationales A and C</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 114</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author cites overwhelming evidence “that students who wish to communicate must acquire this ability in much the same way that speakers, adults or children, acquire it in natural situations.” Given this, “underusers” most resemble children in how they acquire oral proficiency.</li>
    <li>This does not clarify why “underusers” achieve language proficiency, and is only relevant to the extent that learned rules have especially limited usefulness for “underusers.”</li>
    <li>These people, namely, “superusers” are so different from “underusers” in how they acquire language proficiency that their example does not clarify why “underusers” achieve fluency.</li>
    <li>Since this kind of modification can only happen through learned competence, which is low in “underusers,” this does not clarify how “underusers” acquire oral proficiency. </li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 115</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This would only allow second-language students to increase their vocabulary, which monitor theory suggests would be of limited use, especially if they could not put this vocabulary to use in actual situations. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>Assuming that this method is effective, it would only be effective for learning grammar and would not be effective in normal communicative situations.</li>
    <li>Using the second language to request information would be an example of the kind of natural situation that, according to monitor theory, allows language learners to improve their fluency.</li>
    <li>This would only be effective for cognitive- based knowledge such as learning about correct grammar and syntax, which require memorization. Monitor theory would view this as having very limited use for improving fluency, which requires practice in natural situations, not memorization. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
