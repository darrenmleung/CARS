# Passage 3
We must first make a distinction between literature and literary study. The two are distinct activities: One is creative, an art; the other, if not precisely a science, is a species of knowledge or of learning. There have been attempts, of course, to obliterate this distinction. For instance, it has been argued that one cannot understand literature unless one writes it, that one cannot and should not study Pope without trying one’s own hand at heroic couplets or an Elizabethan drama without writing a drama in blank verse.

Yet useful as the experience of literary creation is, the task of the student is completely distinct. The student must translate the experience of literature into intellectual terms, assimilate it to a coherent scheme which must be rational if it is to be knowledge. It may be true that the subject matter is irrational, or at least contains strongly unrational elements; but the student of literature will not be therefore in any other position than the historian of painting or the musicologist or, for that matter, the sociologist or the anatomist. . . .

The problem is one of how intellectually to deal with art, and with literary art specifically. Can it be done? And how can it be done? One answer has been: It can be done with the methods developed by the natural sciences, which need only be transferred to the study of literature. Several kinds of such transfer can be distinguished. One is the attempt to emulate the general scientific ideals of objectivity, impersonality, and certainty, an attempt which on the whole supports the collecting of neutral facts. Another is the effort to imitate the methods of natural science through the study of causal antecedents and origins. . . . Scientific causality is used to explain literary phenomena by the assignment of determining causes to economic, social, and political conditions. Again, there is the introduction of the quantitative methods appropriately used in some sciences—i.e., statistics, charts, and graphs. And finally there is the attempt to use biological concepts in the tracing of the evolution of literature.

Today there would be almost general recognition that this transfer has not fulfilled the expectations with which it was made originally. . . . There is, no doubt, a large field in which the methodologies of science and literary study contact or even overlap. Such fundamental methods as induction and deduction, analysis, synthesis, and comparison are common to all types of systematic knowledge. But patently the other solution commends itself: Literary scholarship has its own valid methods, which are not always those of the natural sciences but are nevertheless intellectual methods.

Only a very narrow conception of truth can exclude the achievements of the humanities from the realm of knowledge. Long before modern scientific development, philosophy, history, jurisprudence, theology, and even philology had worked out valid methods of knowing. Their achievements may have become obscured by the theoretical and practical triumphs of the modern physical sciences, but they are nevertheless real and permanent and can, sometimes with some modifications, easily be resuscitated or renovated. It should be simply recognized that there is this difference between the methods and aims of the natural sciences and the humanities.

# Questions
### 15. What is the main idea of the passage?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Those who create literature understand it more completely than do those who only study it.</li>
  <li>The methodologies of science and the study of literature have many features in common.</li>
  <li>There are valid methods for studying literature that differ from the methods of science.</li>
  <li>The achievements of the humanistic disciplines have been obscured by the achievements of the physical sciences.</li>
</ol>

### 16. According to the passage, the job of the student of literature is to:
<ol type="I">
  <li>discover ways to approach literature intellectually.</li>
  <li>separate the rational from the irrational elements in literary works.</li>
  <li>integrate the experience of literature as art and the analysis of literature as knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="A">
  <li>I only</li>
  <li>II only</li>
  <li>III only</li>
  <li>I and II only</li>
</ol>

### 17. Assume that a scholar is planning an extensive study of the children’s story, *Red Riding Hood*. The author of the passage probably would say that the most important task to be performed is:
<ol type="A">
  <li>examining the social context in which the story was written.</li>
  <li>comparing the occurrence of words indicating various concepts (family relationships, food, emotional states, etc.).</li>
  <li>tracing prior literary influences on the structure of the story and its influence on later works.</li>
  <li>isolating the story elements that explain its enduring popularity.</li>
</ol>

### 18. How could the author best clarify the statement that literature is “irrational, or at least contains strongly unrational elements”?
<ol type="A">
  <li>By providing definitions of both <i>irrational</i> and <i>unrational</i></li>
  <li>By giving an example of an unrational element in a specific work of literature</li>
  <li>By discussing the irrationality of the creative process</li>
  <li>By adding the explanation, “Human behavior is irrational; therefore stories depicting the truth of human behavior are likely to seem unrealistic.”</li>
</ol>

### 19. The passage suggests that the author believes the study of literature to be important because it:
<ol type="A">
  <li>shows that the scientific method can be applied to a wide variety of disciplines.</li>
  <li>helps the student to become more creative.</li>
  <li>teaches that the truth can be discovered by nonscientific means.</li>
  <li>offers a type of knowledge unavailable from other disciplines.</li>
</ol>

### 20. Assume that contemporary literary studies involving a systematic analysis of text have yielded evidence of underlying attitudes that traditional literary criticism had not detected. How does this assumption relate to assertions made in the passage?
<ol type="I">
  <li>It is consistent with the assertion that the transfer of the methods of the natural sciences to art has not fulfilled expectations.</li>
  <li>It constitutes evidence for the assertion that there is a field in which the methodologies of science and literary study overlap.</li>
  <li>It is inconsistent with the assertion that philosophy, history, and theology have worked out valid methods of knowing that can be modified to apply to the humanities.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="A">
  <li>I only</li>
  <li>II only</li>
  <li>I and III only</li>
  <li>II and III only</li>
</ol>

### 21. Elsewhere, the author says that “literature is no substitute for sociology or politics,” nor is it “substitute philosophy.” This statement agrees most closely with the passage assertion that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>literary works are sometimes studied in relation to economic, social, and political conditions.</li>
  <li>literary study has its own unique justifications and aims.</li>
  <li>unlike sociology, politics, or philosophy, literature is an artistic pursuit.</li>
  <li>the methodologies of science and literary study often overlap.</li>
</ol>

  <summary>Question 15</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not imply this, but, rather, points out that these are two separate activities: “One is creative, an art; the other, if not precisely a science, is a species of knowledge or of learning.” The author then elaborates on this distinction, perhaps even implying that more complete knowledge may come from the study than from the creation of literature: ". . . useful as the experience of literary creation is, the task of the student is completely distinct. The student must translate the experience of literature into intellectual terms, assimilate it to a coherent scheme which must be rational if it is to be knowledge.”</li>
    <li>The author makes this point prior to further developing the main idea. See <i>rationale C.</i></li>
    <li>The author explains how some of the methodologies of science and literary study overlap, but then goes on to say that this has not fulfilled expectations and that literary study “has its own valid methods” distinct from the natural sciences: “It should be simply recognized that there is a difference between the methods and aims of the natural sciences and the humanities.”</li>
    <li>This is only a minor point the author makes in acknowledging that this may be so, but the author also proposes that the humanities can be resuscitated to a place of greater prominence.</li>

  <summary>Question 16</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author defines the task of the literature student as a purely intellectual exercise: “The student must translate the experience of literature into intellectual terms, assimilate it to a coherent scheme which must be rational if it is to be knowledge.” The author goes on to describe some of the methods literary study shares with science such as causality, collection of facts, and quantitative methods, and name the methods common to most disciplines such as “induction and deduction, analysis, synthesis, and comparison.”</li>
    <li>The author only acknowledges that literature contains irrational elements, but not that the literature student must separate the rational from the irrational. The author implies that the student of literature only must find rational means of explaining literature, which is no different than the task confronting the musicologist or art historian.</li>
    <li>The author argues against the need to integrate what the author sees as two distinct activities, literature and literary study.</li>
    <li>Only Option I is correct. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 17</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A discussion of the social context would likely focus on elements <i>surrounding</i> the story without getting inside it. Although useful, this approach would not be what the author advocates because such a study would not translate the experience of the story itself into terms that convey knowledge of the story’s literary elements in particular. Arguably, this would be a socio-historical study more than a literary study</li>
    <li>While this approach would illustrate isolated literary elements in relation to isolated concepts, it would be too fragmented and not create the coherent knowledge the author is looking for. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>This would, arguably, be an example of the approach borrowed from evolutionary biology insofar as it would trace the evolution of literature. While the author would not reject that approach, finding it has some validity, the author would not find it entirely satisfactory either. Such a study would mimic science rather than include the valid methods of literary scholarship that are unique to literary study itself. This study would largely focus on matters extraneous to the story itself rather than the experience of the story, which is what the author advocates.</li>
    <li>Isolating the story elements into a coherent argument to the end of explaining the story’s popularity would be an example of the kind of approach the author calls for, which is to “translate the experience of literature into intellectual terms, assimilate it to a coherent scheme which must be rational if it is to be knowledge.”</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 18</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Since <i>unrational</i> is not a part of common usage, and not found in standard dictionaries, the author would need to define it, which would be at best a provisional definition and one lacking authority. The distinction would be better served by a specific instance of an <i>unrational</i> element in a specific literary work. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>The word <i>unrational</i> does not represent common usage and the author is clearly coining a word here meant to be distinguished from <i>irrational</i>, which is familiar to common usage. Therefore, this word would be best served by a specific example.</li>
    <li>This would not explain the implied distinction in <i>degree</i> that the author makes between <i>unrational</i> and <i>irrational</i>.</li>
    <li>This statement would not be relevant to the implied distinction the author is making, since it says nothing about what is meant by <i>unrational</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 19</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author sees this as less important because the author points out how the scientific method by itself is insufficient for literary study.</li>
    <li>The author does not believe this and takes care to distinguish between literature as a creative endeavor and the study of literature: “. . . useful as the experience of literary creation is, the task of the student is <i>completely distinct</i>” (<i>italics added</i>).</li>
    <li>This implies that knowledge and <i>truth</i>, which the author does not discuss, are the same thing. Even if they were the same thing, the author is not simply saying that knowledge (or truth) can be discovered by nonscientific means but, more crucially, that literary study, in particular, offers its own unique form of knowledge.</li>
    <li>The author makes a point about the unique knowledge produced by literary studies: “Literary scholarship has its own valid methods, which are not always those of the natural sciences but are nevertheless intellectual methods.” The author enlarges this discussion to include the unique contributions to knowledge produced by all of the humanities, of which literary study is a part.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 20</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The opposite would be true, namely, that this would be an instance in which transfer did fulfill expectations.</li>
    <li>The author states that analysis is common to all types of systematic knowledge, including literary study. This achievement of contemporary literary studies would provide demonstrable evidence that this was true.</li>
    <li>This would only show that systematic analysis can create new knowledge about literature. It does not logically follow that this added knowledge and methodology would contradict the idea that methods unique only to literary studies have been worked out—these methods would still be unique, even with the addition of one of the scientific methods to the field of literary study. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>Only Option II is correct. See <i>rationales B and C</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 21</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This does not assert the uniqueness of literary study, but, rather, where it intersects with other disciplines.</li>
    <li>The author states: “Literary scholarship has its own valid methods. . . .” This states the author’s main point that, while literary study shares methodologies with other disciplines, it also produces its own unique knowledge.</li>
    <li>The author would say, instead, that literary study is an intellectual discipline, not an artistic endeavor.</li>
    <li>The author takes care to point out that, while there is this overlap, literary study offers methods unique unto itself.</li>
