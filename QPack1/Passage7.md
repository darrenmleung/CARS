# Passage 7
One of the first to speak of the specifically American character was J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, a French settler who published his *Letters from an American Farmer* in 1782. He set the tone for many future discussions when he observed that Americans tended to act with far greater personal initiative and self-reliance than Europeans and that they tended to be unimpressed by social rank or long usage.

Schooled by the philosophes of the eighteenth-century French Enlightenment, Crèvecoeur had no difficulty appraising the typical American as a kind of “new man,” an emancipated, enlightened individual confidently directing energies toward the environment, both natural and social, aiming to wring from it a comfortable happiness. Crèvecoeur wrote of the American that: “Here the rewards of his industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labour; his labour is founded on the basis of nature, *self-interest*; can it want a stronger allurement?” The rational, self-interested individual had emerged as Economic Being and, as such, was conceived as living most naturally in the conditions of a competitive market in which trade and exchange would replace traditional ranks and loyalties as the coordinating mechanism of social life.

But Crèvecoeur’s exclusive emphasis on this aspect of American culture and character blinded him to other facets. He did not see what many Americans of his generation did, that a purely economic person would be as unsuited to a self-governing society as would the rank-bound subject of traditional regimes. Fortunately, another Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, who visited the United States in the 1830s, gave a much more adequate view.

For de Tocqueville, the optimism of the Enlightenment had been tempered by the experience of the French Revolution and its aftermath, and the prophecies of the early political economists were finding an alarmingly negative fulfillment in the industrial infernos of English mill towns. De Tocqueville came to the United States as a sympathetic observer, eager to determine the lessons the first fifty years of the first truly modern nation might have to teach prudent and uncertain Europeans. He added to Crèvecoeur’s earlier sketch a more penetrating and complex understanding of the new society, informed by republican convictions and a deep sensitivity to the place of religion in human life.

In *Democracy in America*, de Tocqueville was concerned to understand the nature of the democratic society he saw everywhere coming into existence but most fully exemplified in the United States. He appreciated the commercial and entrepreneurial spirit that Crèvecoeur had emphasized but saw it as having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom.

De Tocqueville argued that while the physical circumstances of the United States had contributed to the maintenance of a democratic republic, laws had contributed more than those circumstances, and mores (*moeurs*) more than the laws. Indeed, he stressed throughout the book that their mores had been the key to the Americans’ success in establishing and maintaining a free republic and that undermining American mores was the most certain road to undermining the free institutions of the United States. He spoke of mores somewhat loosely, defining them variously as “habits of the heart”; notions, opinions, and ideas that “shape mental habits”; and “the sum of moral and intellectual dispositions of men in society.”

  <summary>Question 42</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author comments that Crèvecoeur failed to see that the purely economic person was unsuited for a self-governing society. See rationale B.</li>
    <li>In commenting about how Crèvecoeur failed to see “that a purely economic person would be as unsuited to a self-governing society as would the rank-bound subject of traditional regimes”, the author suggests that de Tocqueville “gave a much more adequate view”. The author later specifies how de Tocqueville viewed the purely economic man by commenting that de Tocqueville “appreciated the commercial and entrepreneurial spirit [in the U.S.] . . . but saw it as having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom”.</li>
    <li>Enlightenment thinkers influenced Crèvecoeur with their more optimistic view of the rational, self-interested Economic Being. This view is somewhat at odds with de Tocqueville’s more cautious view of the Economic Being. See rationale B.</li>
    <li>Passage information suggests that the French Revolution—and, hence, French revolutionaries—tempered the optimism of the Enlightenment and helped shape de Tocqueville’s more skeptical view.</li>

  <summary>Question 43</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author comments that de Tocqueville was influenced by how “the prophecies of the early political economists [of the Enlightenment] were finding alarmingly negative fulfillment in the industrial infernos of English mill towns”. As a result, de Tocqueville did not share Crèvecouer’s more optimistic sketch of Americans as an “economic people”, but, in rendering a more complex understanding of American life, he harbored reservations about the economic character of America: “He appreciated the commercial and entrepreneurial spirit [in the U.S.] . . . but saw it as having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom”.</li>
    <li>De Tocqueville’s belief in republican principles is underscored by the author’s discussion of how mores, more than even laws or physical circumstances, contributed to maintaining the American democratic republic. The author further maintains that this is a fuller, more “adequate view” than Crèvecoeur’s: “[De Tocqueville] added to Crèvecoeur’s earlier sketch a more penetrating and complex understanding of the new society, informed by republican convictions and a deep sensitivity to the place of religion in human life”.</li>
    <li>The author indicates that Crèvecoeur, more than de Tocqueville, championed the rational self-interest that informed the “Economic Being”. De Tocqueville found the purely economic person as “having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom”.</li>
    <li>The author emphasizes that Crèvecoeur, rather than de Tocqueville, possessed an eighteenth-century education that accounted for his emphasis on “Economic Being” and on enlightened self-interest in producing his sketchier view of American life. Arguably, de Tocqueville, who visited the U.S. in the 1830s, had a nineteenth-century, post-Enlightenment education tempered by the experience of the French Revolution and English mill towns that called some Enlightenment thinking into question.</li>

  <summary>Question 44</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not explicitly discuss de Tocqueville’s view on social rank, although suggests by implication because of his “republican convictions”, de Tocqueville, like Crèvecoeur, would have found in American life an alternative to the “traditional ranks and loyalties as the coordinating mechanism of social life [in Europe]”.</li>
    <li>Crèvecoeur was influenced by eighteenth-century French Enlightenment philosophy whereas Tocqueville was a less enthusiastic proponent: “For de Tocqueville, the optimism of the Enlightenment had been tempered by the experience of the French Revolution and its aftermath, and the prophecies of the early political economists were finding an alarmingly negative fulfillment in the industrial infernos of English mill towns”.</li>
    <li>The author notes that de Tocqueville was informed by “a deep sensitivity to the place of religion in human life”. It may then be reasonable to conclude that religious faith may be one of the factors informing the mores that de Tocqueville saw as shaping American life and maintaining it as a democratic republic.</li>
    <li>While de Tocqueville admired the entrepreneurial spirit, he “saw it as having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom”.</li>

  <summary>Question 45</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not cite economic development in the U.S. as a factor. For Crèvecoeur, American economic development confirmed enlightenment optimism: “The rational, self-interested individual had emerged as Economic Being and, as such, was conceived as living most naturally in the conditions of a competitive market in which trade and exchange would replace traditional ranks and loyalties as the coordinating mechanism of social life”. Even de Tocqueville appreciated the entrepreneurial spirit in the U.S. even though he considered it problematic. However, the author does not cite the American entrepreneurial spirit in particular as leading de Tocqueville to question Enlightenment thinking—it was English mill towns and the French Revolution that made him skeptical of Enlightenment optimism.</li>
    <li>Option I is incorrect. See rationale A.</li>
    <li>In discussing de Tocqueville’s views, the author is explicit on this point: “For de Tocqueville, the optimism of the Enlightenment had been tempered by the experience of the French Revolution and its aftermath, and the prophecies of the early political economists were finding an alarmingly negative fulfillment in the industrial infernos of English mill towns”.</li>
    <li>Option I is incorrect. See rationale A.</li>

  <summary>Question 46</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>According to the author, Crèvecoeur demonstrated more optimism than did de Tocqueville. See rationale B.</li>
    <li>Crèvecoeur based his optimism on the entrepreneurial spirit and self-made, self-reliant qualities of the American “Economic Being,” which the author calls “an emancipated, enlightened individual confidently directing energies toward the environment, both natural and social, aiming to wring from it a comfortable happiness”. However, the author points out that Crèvecoeur could not see what many Americans of his time saw, namely, “that a purely economic person would be unsuited to a self-governing society. . . .” De Tocqueville found reason for pessimism where Crèvecoeur found reason for optimism: “[De Tocqueville] appreciated the commercial and entrepreneurial spirit that Crèvecoeur had emphasized but saw it as having ambiguous and problematic implications for the future of American freedom”.</li>
    <li>The author indicates that Crèvecoeur demonstrated an unabashed optimism based on his Enlightenment faith in the perfectibility of humans: “Schooled by the philosophes of the eighteenth-century French Enlightenment, Crèvecoeur had no difficulty appraising the typical American as . . . an emancipated, enlightened individual confidently directing energies toward the environment, both natural and social, aiming to wring from it a comfortable happiness”.</li>
    <li>Only de Crèvecoeur demonstrated extreme optimism. See rationale B.</li>

  <summary>Question 47</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Option II is also correct. See rationale C.</li>
    <li>Option I is also correct. See rationale C.</li>
    <li>The author comments that Crèvecoeur saw economic well-being as timed to the rational, self-interested individual. The author quotes Crèvecoeur as follows: “ ‘Here the rewards of [the American’s] industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labour; his labour is founded on the basis of nature, <i>self-interest</i>; can it want a stronger allurement’ ”? The author states that de Tocqueville stressed how American mores “had been the key to the Americans’ success . . . and that undermining American mores was the most certain road to undermining the free institutions of the United States”.</li>
    <li>There is no indication in the passage that either Crèvecoeur or de Tocqueville predicted a swift demise for the American experiment. De Tocqueville did see a problematic future for the American experiment, especially should American mores be undermined. See rationale C.</li>
