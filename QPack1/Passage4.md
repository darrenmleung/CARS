# Passage 4
Brand props have played a role in motion pictures for many decades, appearing in films from the late 1940s. The practice of using incidental properties with recognizable labels in films began casually. Brand-name items were simply donated, loaned, or purchased for particular scenes to enhance their verisimilitude or aesthetic qualities. Today, brand placement, the purposeful placement of commercial products within feature films, is a multimillion-dollar business, driven by the need of marketers to increase their media options for product exposure.

Brands can be integrated in a film in three ways: The product itself may be used by an actor, a logo or advertisement may be featured, or a sign may be displayed in the background. For placements that are directly purchased, fees are usually based on a hierarchy of product treatments. Simple visual exposure is the least expensive, verbal mention is moderately priced, and character usage is the most costly. Brand-placement has obvious advantages for marketers, giving them captive audiences, demonstrating the acceptance of their product in naturalistic contexts, and providing greater consumer reach than traditional media, thus providing relatively cost-efficient advertising. For filmmakers, the arrangement not only offsets production costs but contributes to the realism of contemporary settings.

A number of studies have used paid focus groups and in-depth interviews to clarify the way audiences interpret brand placements in relation to movies, movie viewing, and social experience. The results are consistent. Older informants consider the use of brand props an innovation that changes their movie-going experience. They report feeling resistance, discomfort, and concern. In contrast, younger informants consider the appearance of name-brand products in the story an acceptable and expected part of the movie-going experience and not a change. For them, encounters with familiar products are associated with feelings of belonging, comfort, and security.

These findings convey a clear and convincing message: The success of brand props in exerting persuasive effects is not a matter of what the placements do to <i>movie audiences</i> but what the audiences do <i>with them</i>. The meaning and relevance of brands encountered in films are not simply transmitted to viewers; rather, viewers interpret these props as part of their own everyday life, and in reflecting the viewers’ past, present, and anticipated experiences, the props come to life.

Critics label brand placement deceptive and insidiously manipulative and want public officials to regulate or even to ban the practice. One of our studies counters the critics’ argument and suggests that their charge is groundless. Criticism of brand placement as a deceptive practice is based on the premise that the appearance of brand props in movie scenes has a causal relationship to buying behavior. Behind this premise is the assumption that moviegoers are unaware of the persuasive intent behind placements and are naïve about the practice in general.

But our interviews convincingly demonstrate that moviegoers are more sophisticated in their understanding of the practice than critics would have public policy officials believe. As indicated by their own comments, moviegoers are active interpreters, not passive receivers, of movie presentations of brands. Furthermore, they are not influenced uniformly by these encounters, a finding that suggests a mitigating effect by other factors–e.g., perceived needs, self-image, past experiences, plot context, and demographic group–on any induced tendency to purchase the product. The audience awareness of the persuasive intention of brand props in fact promotes skepticism and resistance to their persuasive influence. For various reasons, moviegoers may allow themselves certain indulgences in some buying situations, but they are not deceived into rushing out of movie houses to buy everything shown in a movie.

  <summary>Question 22</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>“Verbal mention is moderately priced”, implying that this technique is moderately effective in promoting sales.</li>
    <li>“Simple visual exposure is the least expensive”, implying that it is least effective for marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>Unless the shot showed the product in use by a character (see <i>rationale D</i>), a close-up image of it would constitute simple visual exposure (see <i>rationale B</i>).</li>
    <li>Presumably, the marketing effectiveness of the various forms of presentation corresponds to the hierarchy of fees charged to filmmakers. “Character usage is the most costly”.</li>

  <summary>Question 23</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Not only is the entire passage a defense of brand placement but its wording provides multiple indications of the author’s approval of this form of advertising. One clue is the loaded term need in the phrase “the need of marketers to increase their media options for product exposure, which implicitly justifies the practice, as a more objective noun, such as <i>wish</i> or <i>incentive</i>, would not. Furthermore, the instructional tone of “brands can be integrated in a film in three ways” suggests that the passage is addressed specifically to marketers. (Wording more appropriate for a general readership would be “brands <i>are</i> integrated” or “promoters <i>integrate</i> brands.”) Information on fees is also of interest primarily to those considering paying them. Similarly, the assessment “providing relatively cost-efficient advertising” implicitly assumes the perspective of potential advertisers.</li>
    <li>The declaration “one of our studies counters the critics’ argument and suggests that their charge is groundless” not only reveals the author’s involvement in this research but states the researchers’ conclusion in a confrontational style that is not the neutral language of science. Impartial investigators of a controversial practice would not take a stance in opposition to those who criticize it. Nor would they reject an argument on the basis of one study, and they would be cautious in interpreting data that consisted of opinions solicited in interviews. Furthermore, the glibness of the unsupported assertions “these studies convey a clear and convincing message” and “our interviews convincingly demonstrate” implies only that the author is convinced.</li>
    <li>The author seems credulous rather than mistrustful, dismissing on the basis of a single and apparently biased study the concerns of those who do mistrust disguised advertising in films (see <i>rationale B</i>).</li>
    <li>The author’s comments on brand placement convey no hint of disapproval (See <i>rationale A</i>).</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 24</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>It is only the younger informants in the author’s survey who report psychological benefits from the recognition of brand products in films.</li>
    <li>According to the author, older informants consider the brand-placement phenomenon a distracting innovation about which they “report feeling resistance, discomfort, and concern”.</li>
    <li>While the passage equivocates about whether brand placement is ultimately cost effective for marketers, it is definite about its immediate reception by audiences. The author argues that, whatever the effect of brand props on buying decisions, they do not induce this effect subliminally and concludes that viewer awareness of the commercial intention behind the appearance of brand names on the screen actually strengthens their sales resistance to it. “They are not deceived into rushing out of movie houses to buy everything shown in a movie”.</li>
    <li>The passage does not suggest that unfavorable audience responses to brand placement has reduced attendance at films that use that technique.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 25</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage does not report the information given to participants in the studies or the questions they were asked.</li>
    <li>Age was not necessarily the only factor studied. The author reports the results of age-based analyses only because they yielded consistent differences.</li>
    <li>Although social interactions possibly (not “probably”) influence the opinions expressed in “paid focus groups and in-depth interviews”, these confounding factors would be particularly relevant only for studies of attitudes about brand placement as a marketing practice. But since the conclusions drawn from the studies concern “the success of brand props in exerting persuasive effects” and “any induced tendency to purchase the product”, a more basic question to be asked is whether the research methods are appropriate to these questions (see <i>rationale D</i>).</li>
    <li>The question addressed by the research is “the success of brand props in exerting persuasive effects” The extent of this success could be clearly manifested only by deviations from a base rate in consumer spending on targeted brands. Interviews are necessarily less reliable guides to overt behaviors than are direct measurements of those behaviors. The passage provides no reason to accept the apparent premise of the research that opinions elicited in “paid focus groups and in-depth interviews” can predict the buying decisions of uninformed theater audiences who have been exposed to the brand placement technique. In fact, the author does not imply that any correspondence has been found between these opinions and subsequent specific purchases by even the group participants.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 26</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Since younger audiences reportedly feel comfortable and secure when they recognize product brands that are featured in films, the failure of young viewers to respond to the implicit message that attractive adolescents prefer Voom shoes suggests that the brand name does not evoke positive feelings among this group because it is unfamiliar to them.</li>
    <li>A film with attractive adolescent protagonists would probably attract young audiences, the age group for which the film presentation of familiar brands “are associated with feelings of belonging”. If the Voom promotion does not increase the perceived desirability of these shoes, young persons probably do not recognize the brand “as part of their own everyday life”; see <i>rationale A</i>). Therefore, most members of the audience probably do not own Voom shoes.</li>
    <li>C.	Since the film is successful among the young, who presumably represent a large proportion of its audience (see <i>rationale B</i>), and since “younger informants consider the appearance of name-brand products in the story an acceptable and expected part of the movie-going experience”, a relatively small proportion of those attending the film would be troubled by scenes with a commercial intention. These older viewers presumably are not typical buyers of Voom shoes, so their concerns would probably not explain the failure of the brand placement to stimulate sales.</li>
    <li>According to the author, interviews conducted with moviegoers indicate that they are “active interpreters . . . of movie presentations of brands” with “awareness of the persuasive intention of brand props”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 27</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>An agency of the Commerce Department would be alert to unethical practices. In investigating the multimillion-dollar brand-placement business, its “public policy officials” would not base their conclusions on consumer surveys but would investigate such questionable matters as the role of feature films as an advertising medium and the honesty of film companies toward the public about the commercial sponsorship of particular films. And a federal regulatory agency would not report its findings as the vindication of a practice that it seemed to favor.</li>
    <li>The passage wording most plausibly suggests that the opinion-gathering procedures mentioned were conducted by advertisers and meant to reassure marketers.</li>
    <li>In studying product placement, the apparent goal of the passage author was to reach reassuring conclusions. An organization formed to protect consumers would be more likely to investigate the validity of such reassurances in order to address the concerns being expressed about the practice.</li>
    <li>Experimental psychologists are trained to conduct carefully controlled experiments in accord with appropriate scientific procedures and to report in an objective way data that prove statistically significant. No wording in the passage indicates the operation of such restraint in either the methodology or the conclusions discussed (see <i>rationale B</i>).</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 28</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Defenders of brand placement discount the importance of film exposure to the consumer demand for mass-produced products with brand names. Their argument has no obvious relevance to sales of animals or real estate.</li>
    <li>The finding that the dissemination of information on brand placement has no commercial effect would support the author’s argument that moviegoers already have a sophisticated understanding of the practice.</li>
    <li>The author argues that because of their understanding of the persuasive intention behind brand placements, film audiences resist their influence, and therefore any apparent association between the use of this technique and an increase in sales is due to other factors–various incentives that certain audience members have to buy the product. Implicitly, the appearance on the screen of the brand products simply activates these factors. This argument would be undermined by the finding that prior warning of the brands to be promoted in a film reduces sales of those products, since the drop in sales would imply that unwarned audiences are not aware of the influence of brands visible during films and therefore are not resisting it.</li>
    <li>The passage argument does not pertain to promotional films, which do not disguise their commercial purpose, to purchases customarily made in movie theaters, nor to products without a brand name.</li>
  </ol>
