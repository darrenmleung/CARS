# Passage 14
Some people may have no friendships of a high level of moral excellence. And, as Aristotle recognized, some people may actually be incapable of such friendships. A truly selfish person could not have friends in the fullest sense. If someone were genuinely able to care for another person for the other’s own sake, if someone were able to give much of him- or herself to the other freely and for the other’s own sake, then he or she would not be selfish.

It is true that selfish people can be very attached to one or another person—e.g., a spouse or friend. But it seems that such a friendship could not be a friendship of the most morally excellent kind. The attachment or friendship would be too grounded in self-centered considerations. Thus, a selfish man could be very attached to his wife, dote on her, and in some ways do a lot for her. But this would not mean that he really cared for her for her own sake. His behavior would be compatible with his caring for her, so to speak, for her willingness to serve him, to be at his command, to flatter his ego. His giving could be a minor concession for her serving him or even a further expression or assertion of his power over her and of her dependence on him. If he were truly selfish, then something like this would be the most likely explanation of his “beneficent” behavior.

Nevertheless, it would be wrong to say that selfish people cannot really have friends at all, in any sense of the term. For first of all, there are important aspects of friendship besides caring for the other—i.e., enjoying being with the other person, or sharing certain kinds of activities, or liking the other person. So selfish people can have friends, in that there are others whom they like and enjoy sharing certain kinds of activities with. Second, even selfish people can wish others well, be well disposed toward others.

Thus, there are very different levels of friendship, levels which are understood in moral terms, in terms of how fully one cares for the other. Friendship always involves a giving of self to the other and a valuing of the other for his or her own sake. Friendship is an expression of moral activity on our part.

In caring about the weal and woe of my friend Dave, it is integral to the nature of this caring that it be for someone whom I like, whom I know likes me, who cares about my weal and woe, whom I trust, who is personally important to me, who cares about our friendship, etc. In acting from friendship toward Dave, I express my acknowledgment of a relationship which includes all these feelings and attitudes. This is why the caring and the acts of beneficence are not separate from my own interests, from what is personally a good to me. In fact, friendship is a context in which the division between self-interest and other-interest is often not applicable.

</ol>

### 84. If the author of the passage is right that friendship blurs the distinction between one’s own interests and the interests of one’s friends, then it follows that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>by their very nature, friendships foster cooperation and reduce antagonism.</li>
  <li>selfishness must still find expression, but only in relationships with those who are not one’s friends.</li>
  <li>friendship can really begin only between people who know each other very well.</li>
  <li>friends become more and more alike the longer they are together.</li>
</ol>

### 85. Regarding the reciprocity and transitivity of friendship, the passage strongly implies that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>if Mary is a friend to Bill, and Bill is a friend to Tom, then Mary is a friend to Tom.</li>
  <li>if Mary and Bill are friends, they satisfy the same needs in one another.</li>
  <li>Mary and Bill could have a true friendship in which Bill does most of the giving and Mary does most of the receiving.</li>
  <li>Mary cannot be a friend to Bill if Bill is not a friend to Mary, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>

  <summary>Question 81</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The question refers to a husband whose caring behavior toward his wife may actually be assertions of his power over her and her dependence on him. Similarly, in giving relatively light sentences to criminals who are respectful in demeanor, a judge is using the power to bestow this gift to elicit the show of respect.</li>
    <li>This situation does not exemplify giving as an assertion of power because the person asserting the power (the boss) is not doing the giving.</li>
    <li>This giving does not involve the assertion of power, since the giver’s motive is to alleviate hunger.</li>
    <li>The husband is offering a suggestion about a gift that both partners might give to themselves. No assertion of power or dependency is indicated.</li>

  <summary>Question 82</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The statement that “a truly selfish person could not have friends in the fullest sense” is supported by an argument based on the meaning of <i>selfish</i>.</li>
    <li>The statement that “there are important aspects of friendship besides caring for the other” is supported by three examples.</li>
    <li>A “likely explanation of . . . ‘beneficent’ behavior” is provided by the example of a selfish man who dotes on his wife.</li>
    <li>No evidence is offered to justify the conclusion that “even selfish people can wish others well”.</li>

  <summary>Question 83</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The equation of friendship and morality is based on the argument that the level of a friendship depends on the extent to which “one cares for the other”. The author’s disagreements with a friend about shared activities would not weaken this abstract view of friendship.</li>
    <li>People who argue about the way to spend shared time are expressing opposing interests. Therefore evidence that friends have such arguments would weaken the argument that friendship blurs the distinction between self-interest and other-interest.</li>
    <li>Evidence that friends argue over activities implies nothing about the motive for such disputes or about the participants’ <u>capacity</u> for friendship. However, if such arguments did indicate selfishness, they would <u>strengthen</u>, not weaken, the assertion that some people are incapable of friendship “in the fullest sense”—i.e., of caring for another “for the other’s own sake”.</li>
    <li>The author asserts that because of the mutual liking, trust, and caring between them, acts of friendship toward Dave “are not separate from my own interests”. Accordingly, arguments about specific activities could constitute acts of friendship, helping each friend to evaluate the activities in terms of self-interest, which would include the value placed on the friendship.</li>

  <summary>Question 84</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author’s reason for concluding that between friends, “the division between self-interest and other-interest is often not applicable” is the premise that reciprocally acknowledged liking, caring, trusting, etc., are integral to friendship. Such feelings imply a mutual inclination to cooperate.</li>
    <li>A community of interest with one’s friends does not imply competitive relations with other acquaintances, and the passage does not suggest that everyone has selfish drives that must somehow find expression.</li>
    <li>The assumption that in promoting the interest of a friend one serves one’s self-interest implies that friends are aware of one another’s wishes. It does not imply that two persons must become thoroughly familiar with each other before their friendship can begin.</li>
    <li>The idea that friendship is characterized by a commonality of interests implies that the more similar the friends’ interests, the more likely their friendship is to endure—i.e., similarity promotes friendship. It does not imply that friendship promotes similarity.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 85</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage implies nothing about transitivity. The activities Bill shares with Mary may differ from those he shares with Tom. Therefore Mary and Tom may not have a sufficient basis for friendship.</li>
    <li>The passage argues that friendship is unselfish. It “always involves a giving of the self to the other”. This argument would be meaningless if the needs of the other and of the self were identical.</li>
    <li>The views expressed by the author do not imply the possibility of so unbalanced a friendship (see <i>rationale D</i>).</li>
    <li>The author insists that friendship means <u>reciprocal</u> caring, liking, and trust.</li>
