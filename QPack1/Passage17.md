# Passage 17
Many who acknowledge that beliefs about the brain reflect the state of the science of the day will deny that political values have anything to do with the matter. Yet consider the highly charged public discourse on whether mental illnesses are biological or psychological—that is, whether they are "no one's fault" or "caused" by parents, spouses, the patients themselves, or social conditions.

The underlying quest by the families of the mentally ill is for moral exculpation. The fight between psychiatrists and psychologists about psychopharmacology is in part about their hegemony over patients. Social biologists attribute the preponderance of mental disorders among the lowest socioeconomic-status quintile to downward drift; social activists assign it to the malign effects of economic deprivation.

The idea that the biological self is socially constructed may seem outrageous. Admittedly, it is an extrapolation from data indicating that while the genes controlling embryonic development shape the infant brain, experience establishes the intricate neural connections underlying that brain's functioning. This fine-tuning of brain anatomy surely continues throughout adulthood.

Few psychiatrists today would dispute that the brain structures and functions revealed by contemporary neuroscience accord with current knowledge on the development of behavior. We have learned that neurons and their processes overgrow luxuriantly in the course of development and that it is experience that selects the survivors. True, the basic ground plan is laid out in the genome, but the precise neuroanatomic details are specified by activity-dependent competition between presynaptic axons for common postsynaptic target neurons.

The visual system is a prime example of brain development. Genetically controlled mechanisms generate a coarse-grained topographic map; it is neural activity that etches the details of this map. A deprivation of stimulation need not be total to disrupt normal development; human astigmatism, if unrecognized and untreated, leads to permanent deficits in visual acuity. Nature and nurture stand in a relationship of reciprocity, not opposition.

The early steps in the development of language are akin to the experience-dependent development of the visual system. All healthy human infants are born with an aptitude for language acquisition, an aptitude that is uniquely human. Therefore, linguistic potential, by definition, is specified in the human genome. Auditory learning begins before birth. The human infant in utero hears its mother's voice repeatedly. On tests shortly after birth, and before hearing its mother speak under the new environmental conditions, it is able to discriminate her recorded voice from the voices of other women. Four-day-old French infants will suck harder (the means by which they control the auditory stimulus presented) in order to hear French instead of Russian because of the in-utero development of this "preference."

Young infants can detect differences between phonemes in all languages, including those that are not used in their native language. Older preschoolers, however, like adults, are able to discriminate the phonemic nuances of only the languages they acquired in early life. Children are able to infer grammatical rules from exemplars without ever being taught grammar per se. That fact, too, must reflect unique features of the human brain. However, the capacity to use grammar does not spring, like Minerva, fully formed from the head of Jove. Its acquisition and elaboration depend on social interaction. Whether a child acquires any language at all, let alone a specific language, is determined by the child's linguistic community. One's ultimate degree of linguistic competence is a function of nature, nurture, and niche.

# Questions
### 96. The term *socially* constructed in the discussion of mental development refers to the influence of:
<ol type="A">
  <li>interactions with peer members on personality traits.</li>
  <li>assigned role in group structure on self-concept.</li>
  <li>experiences with others on neuronal organization.</li>
  <li>verbal exchanges on linguistic understanding.</li>
</ol>

### 97. The author implies that families seek knowledge about the mental problem with which a relative has been diagnosed only because of:
<ol type="A">
  <li>regret at having ignored its severity.</li>
  <li>a wish to avoid being considered guilty.</li>
  <li>concern that the cause may be genetic.</li>
  <li>uncertainty about their moral obligations.</li>
</ol>

### 98. The author asserts that children can infer the rules of their language without explicit instruction. Yet the speech of older children is often ungrammatical by adult standards. Can these two assertions be reconciled by the author's argument?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes; innate aptitude, early exposure, and linguistic community all contribute to competence.</li>
  <li>Yes; the natural language-acquisition process may be disrupted by adult attempts to teach grammar.</li>
  <li>No; the language exemplars children hear are frequently grammatically substandard.</li>
  <li>No; congenital learning disabilities or emotional disorders can adversely affect children's speech.</li>
</ol>

### 99. In terming certain neurons *survivors*, the author means those that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>frequently participate in mental operations.</li>
  <li>are genetically programmed for longer life.</li>
  <li>are structurally well adapted to their function.</li>
  <li>achieve an overdevelopment of dendritic processes.</li>
</ol>

### 100. According to passage information, which of the following activities by a pregnant woman would most clearly promote the cognitive development of the infant?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Listening to symphonies</li>
  <li>Reading classic literature</li>
  <li>Solving problems in logic</li>
  <li>Conversing with friends</li>
</ol>

# Answers

  <summary>Question 96</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The influence of interactions with peer members on personality traits does not enter the discussion.</li>
    <li>The discussion at this point in the passage focuses on the establishment of neural connections.</li>
    <li>The discussion in which the term <i>socially constructed</i> is used indicates this influence: “The idea that the biological self is socially constructed may seem outrageous. Admittedly, it is an extrapolation from data indicating that while the genes controlling embryonic development shape the infant brain, experience establishes the intricate neural connections underlying that brain’s functioning.”</li>
    <li>This discussion about experience-dependent linguistic development is found later in the passage and is not an elaboration on the use of <i>socially constructed</i> as at the point at which the term occurs. See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 97</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author does not indicate that regret plays any role.</li>
    <li>The passage implies that this is a motivation for seeking knowledge of a relative’s mental problem: “The underlying quest by the families of the mentally ill is for moral exculpation.”</li>
    <li>Although genetic causes may be a concern in some quarters, the passage author indicates that families tend to feel guilty about the mental problems of relatives. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>The passage indicates that families are concerned about their moral obligations—namely, to themselves—in seeking moral exculpation. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 98</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author points out that along with this innate ability to infer grammatical rules comes the influence of social interaction and the linguistic community the child inhabits: “. . . the capacity to use grammar does not spring, like Minerva, fully formed from the head of Jove. Its acquisition and elaboration depend on social interaction. Whether a child acquires any language at all, let alone a specific language, is determined by the child’s linguistic community.”</li>
    <li>This would only be true if the grammar were taught badly. Instead, the natural language-acquisition process is ultimately not only a product of nature but also of nurture and niche.</li>
    <li>The passage does not explicitly state nor imply that these language exemplars are frequently substandard, only that they influence a child’s language acquisition. The exemplars could just as easily be grammatically competent as substandard.</li>
    <li>Although congenital learning disabilities or emotional disorders can affect language acquisition, these represent anomalies and would not affect the passage author’s point that ungrammatical speech in older children could also result from social interaction and the linguistic community of the child.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 99</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author points out that the <i>survivors</i> are neurons that are most experienced, or “activity-dependent,” meaning that they participate the most in mental operations: “We have learned that neurons and their processes overgrow luxuriantly in the course of development and that it is experience that selects the survivors. True, the basic ground plan is laid out in the genome, but the precise neuroanatomic details are specified by activity-dependent competition between presynaptic axons for common postsynaptic target neurons.”</li>
    <li>Neurons are initially genetically programmed but are reprogrammed through activity-dependent use. See <i>rationale</i> A.</li>
    <li>The observation that neurons “overgrow luxuriantly” suggests that they are not necessarily always structurally well adapted to their function.</li>
    <li>Dendritic processes are not discussed in the passage.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 100</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The influence of music heard in utero is not discussed in the passage; therefore, no inference can be made about how symphonies would affect cognitive development.</li>
    <li>Reading classic literature would likely have no effect because this activity could not be heard in utero.</li>
    <li>Solving problems in logic would have no effect since the infant could not hear this process in utero.</li>
    <li>The passage discusses how auditory learning begins before birth with the infant hearing its mother’s voice in utero, which influences the infant’s aptitude for language acquisition. Given this, conversations between the mother and friends would most likely influence the infant’s cognitive and linguistic development.</li>
