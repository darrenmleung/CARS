# Passage 8
Both employers and workers are challenged by technological innovations, international trade, deregulation, and changes in the nature and structure of work. Their responses to these challenges indicate their choice of three roads to the new economy. The low road follows the historic path of mass production, emphasizing downsizing, outsourcing, and low-skill employees as ways to cut labor costs. Eventually, this approach, if the norm, must limit a nation's economic competitiveness, living standard, and income equity.

The high road acknowledges the growing value of investment in highly skilled employees who can react quickly to changing technologies and markets. It presupposes shared power and long-term goals. Only dominant firms can afford to commit resources to training and keeping employees by providing full benefits with high wages. Such firms tend to be protected from domestic or international competitors by technological advantages, large-scale production, or government regulations. Currently, high-road firms account for perhaps 20 percent of employees in the United States.

About 40 percent of U.S. workers receive no formal training beyond a high-school education. They must submit to the contingencies of low-road employment, remaining at the periphery of the new economy. The remaining 40 percent of the workforce slog along the muddy middle road, getting some advanced education or job-related training but unlikely to enter the dynamic high-road labor market and attract employers who would train them thoroughly to join their core workers.

The high road is not an easy course for employers to take. Today's global customers and suppliers are linked by a web of standards that affect not only prices but extend to the quality and variety of products, company organization, customer service and its timeliness, and constant innovations. Employers who meet these complex requirements use computer-based methods, which raise the level of skill needed by nonsupervisory personnel. For example, instead of checking the quality of the final product, high-road firms integrate quality standards in their automated production process, encouraging workers at all stages of their operation to demonstrate expertise and responsibility.

High-performance work systems are most successful when training and work reforms are bundled. Similarly, workers find that their general education, occupational preparation, and access to training on the job are complementary in their effect on earnings. Workers who receive formal company training command higher wages than do similar workers who attend only vocational school or receive informal on-the-job instruction. Workers who use computers on the job also earn more than do those of the same education level who do not use computers at work. Moreover, the earning difference increases with the level of technological competence.

For the United States to compete in an eventual global economy based on skilled workers and quality products, additional employer investment in training is needed now. Policies at all levels should encourage the coordination of employer-provided training and broader schooling. Such policies will realize the highest returns in terms of personal income, adaptation to an increasingly volatile labor market, and efficiency in the transmission of changing skill requirements from workplaces to schools. Although for a particular job, employer-based training or vocational preparation can substitute for generalized schooling, specific training degrades rapidly, and narrow skills seldom transfer well to new job requirements.

But although high-wage, high-skill jobs create a demand for education and training, training does not create high-wage jobs. Ultimately, a strategy of investment in human capital succeeds or flounders according to the availability of high-wage, high-skill jobs. If investment in workers outpaces the number of good jobs, many very competent workers will face an employment market of many very undemanding jobs.

<ol type="A">
  <li>the repeal of regulations that protect dominant firms.</li>
  <li>an increase in spending on the training of employees.</li>
  <li>an emphasis on high school vocational education.</li>
  <li>the use of computers in industrial production.</li>
</ol>

### 51. Which of the following situations is most likely to constitute a *muddy* road, as the author uses the term?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Being trained in a skill that qualifies one for only a particular job</li>
  <li>Switching to unfamiliar procedures because of technological changes</li>
  <li>Returning to college to upgrade one's professional qualifications</li>

  <li>Close monitoring of the productivity of workers by their immediate supervisors</li>
  <li>The democratic participation of workers in the hiring of potential co-workers</li>
  <li>A profit-sharing program that rewards workers for company successes</li>
</ol>

### 53. An employer reasons: "If I train my workers, competitors who save money by not providing training will be able to attract my trained workers with higher salaries than I can pay." What possible solution for this employer would most accord with the author's high road?

  <li>investment in training keeps costs low by providing a large pool of skilled workers.</li>
  <li>in highly paid work, on-the-job training compensates for educational deficiencies.</li>
  <li>training is not effective unless it is supplemented by a comprehensive education.</li>
  <li>some highly trained workers may not benefit financially from their training.</li>

  <summary>Question 48</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Competitiveness in international trade is just one of the challenges named by the author; other factors affecting competitiveness include “technological innovations, . . . deregulation, and changes in the nature and structure of work.” All of these are will be negatively influenced by the “low-road” approach.</li>
    <li>The author makes two observations revealing that the author is particularly concerned about the United States. The first concerns the part of U.S. work force that is employed by low-road firms: “About 40 percent of U.S. workers receive no formal training beyond a high-school education.” The second concerns U.S. competitiveness in particular: “For the United States to compete in an eventual global economy based on skilled workers and quality products, additional employer investment in training is needed now.”</li>
    <li>The author’s focus is not just on technology-based economies but on the United States in particular, where “high-road firms account for perhaps 20 percent of employees.” See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>The author’s focus is on the United States, including the international competitiveness of U.S. firms, not on less developed nations. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>

  <summary>Question 49</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>It does not necessarily follow that using a computer for so simple a task as this would increase earning power, especially if the whole purpose of the computer program is to make this task faster and easier than it otherwise would be so workers have more time for other things. Moreover, the author points out that earning power increases with the level of technological competence and one could reasonably conclude that making schedules would not require a high level of technological sophistication.</li>
    <li>It logically follows that the use of e-mail alone to generate business would be limiting oneself too much and that one who also generates business with letters and other means in addition to using e-mail would reach a wider range of potential clients. Using e-mail in this was is only one small aspect of generating business as an executive. The author is referring to the more sophisticated use of computers in ways that are more central to the performance of the job than simply using e-mail. See rationale D.</li>
    <li>This finding does not apply to the passage since the author does not emphasize job efficiency but, rather, emphasizes more extensive quality control measures as a consequence of automating production.</li>
    <li>The author asserts the earning power of being able to use a computer on the job: “Workers who use computers on the job also earn more than do those of the same education level who do not use computers at work. Moreover, the earning difference increases with the level of technological competence.”</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 50</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not advocate the repeal of these regulations and only refers to them once in the context of simply explaining that these regulations are a factor in why dominant firms can afford to train and keep employees.</li>
    <li>The author emphasizes the importance of investing in worker training in high-road firms and producing “highly skilled employees who can react quickly to changing technologies and markets.” The author also emphasizes what kind of investment in worker training is most desirable: “Workers who receive formal company training command higher wages than do similar workers who attend only vocational school or receive informal on-the-job instruction.”</li>
    <li>The author does not consider this kind of training as effective as formal company training. See <i>rationale B</i>.</li>
    <li>The author discusses very little the role of computers in industrial production, devoting much of the passage to explaining the need for a highly-skilled workforce, and how computer skills enhance their earning power and adaptability as workers.</li>

<details>
  <summary>Question 51</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>In discussing the “muddy road,” the author specifically refers to workers who get “Some advanced education or job-related training but [are] unlikely to enter the dynamic high-road labor market. . . .” The author later warns of this phenomenon again in discussing job-related training: “Although for a particular job, employer-based training or vocational preparation can substitute for general schooling, specific training degrades rapidly, and narrow skills seldom transfer well to new job requirements.”</li>
    <li>The author does not specifically relate “muddy road” to switching to unfamiliar procedures because of technological changes, although such unfamiliarity could be an outcome of too narrow of an education.</li>
    <li>While the author generally finds this as less effective than formal on-the-job training, returning to school and advancing one’s education can be further complemented by on-the-job training: “Workers find that their general education, occupational preparation, and access to training on the job are complementary in their effect on earnings.”</li>
    <li>Inability to move into higher paying, high-skill positions, not chronic unemployment, characterizes the experience of the “muddy road.” See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 52</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>In discussing automated production processes, the author advocates “encouraging workers at all stages of their operation to demonstrate expertise and responsibility.” Using a computerized bulletin board to share tips with one another is a way of empowering workers by giving them expertise and responsibility.</li>
    <li>The author would not advocate close supervision by superiors, since this would give workers less responsibility and opportunity to use their technological competence. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The hiring of co-workers, while empowering to workers, is not directly related to the production process, and the production process is the focus here. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>A profit sharing program increases the stakes workers have in a firm but it is not related to giving them more responsibility and technological skill in the production process, which is the author’s more central concern in the passage. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 53</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not indicate any interest in such regulations, making only one reference to regulations in the passage.</li>
    <li>The author encourages policies that realize the highest returns, and, while the author does not discuss a policy of repaying tuition, such a policy would be consistent with the author’s advocacy of putting policies in place that further worker training goals, for example, policies that “encourage the coordination of employer-provided training and broader schooling.”</li>
    <li>The author advocates firms developing their own training programs and likely would discourage this practice.</li>
    <li>The author nowhere refers to cutting costs as an effective strategy, instead taking a more proactive approach of investing in formal worker training.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 54</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author nowhere mentions the availability of a large pool of skilled workers as a benefit of the situations described. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The author in particular states: “. . . although high-wage, high-skill jobs create a demand for education and training, training does not create high-wage jobs.” The author is saying that on-the-job training does <i>not</i> compensate for educational deficiencies when jobs do not exist in the first place.</li>
    <li>The author generally states the opposite point, namely, that a comprehensive education must be supplemented by formal job-related training. The author in particular states: “. . . although high-wage, high-skill jobs create a demand for education and training, training does not create high-wage jobs,” which is <i>not</i> saying that training is not effective unless supplemented by a comprehensive education.</li>
    <li>The author, in advocating training workers for high-skilled positions, offers by way of warning the caveat that all trained workers may not benefit from advanced training: “If the investment in workers outpaces the number of good jobs, many very competent workers will face an employment market of many very undemanding jobs.”</li>
