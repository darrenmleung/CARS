# Passage 10
Zoroaster, the founder of the Zoroastrian religion, was an Iranian who lived between about 1400 and 1200 B.C. He was thirty when revelation came to him. It is said that Zoroaster went at dawn to a river to fetch water and had a vision of the god Ahura Mazda calling him to his service, a summons that he wholeheartedly obeyed. Mazda had been worshipped of old as the greatest of the three Ahuras, the guardians of order; but Zoroaster went much further and, in a startling departure from accepted beliefs, proclaimed Ahura Mazda to be the one uncreated god, existing eternally, and creator of all else that is good.

In the vision, Zoroaster beheld, co-existing with Ahura Mazda, an adversary, the “hostile spirit,” Angra Mainyu, equally uncreated but ignorant and wholly malign. An essential element in this revelation is that the two primal beings each made a deliberate choice between good and evil, an act that prefigures the identical choice that all persons must make for themselves in this life. Ahura Mazda fashioned the world as a battleground for their two forces. At the end of history, Ahura Mazda will win the great struggle to destroy evil and so achieve a universe that will be wholly good forever.

The lucid and comprehensive doctrines taught by Zoroaster left little scope for heresy or schism. Yet they must have given the magi (Zoroastrian converts of the sixth century B.C.) much new matter to ponder. One of the most striking elements in the prophet’s teachings was the concept of history having an end. The magi had also become familiar with very different Babylonian speculations about history being divided into great recurrent cycles of time in which all events repeated themselves; and contrasting such theories with Zoroaster’s teachings may well have led them to reflect much on time and its nature.

The result was the Zurvanite heresy. The word *zurvan* means time. The Zurvanites came to believe that time, Zurvan, did not merely provide the framework for events but was actually in control of them, hence a sentient being. They found their main scriptural justification for this belief in Zoroaster’s verse: “Truly there are two primal spirits, twins, renowned to be in conflict.” Meditating upon this text, they postulated with scholastic ingenuity that for twins, there must be a father; and the only possible father for Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu was Zurvan, time. Zurvan was held to be a remote first cause. He does not himself intervene in the present struggle between his “sons.” The Zurvanites felt themselves to be the most truly orthodox followers of Zoroaster, who had divined the correct meaning of the prophet’s words.

But theirs was in fact a deep and grievous heresy, for by declaring that Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu were brothers, the Zurvanites betrayed Zoroaster’s fundamental doctrine that good and evil are utterly separate and distinct by origin and nature. They also diminished the grandeur of Ahura Mazda. Moreover, the Zurvanite preoccupation with fate and the inexorable decrees of time obscured the basic Zoroastrian doctrine of free will and the power of individuals to shape their own destiny through the exercise of choice. Zurvanism finally disappeared some centuries after the coming of Islam.

  <summary>Question 61</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage states that the “deliberate choice between good and evil” made by each of “the two primal beings” is an essential element of Zoroaster’s revelation and that “the identical choice” must be made by “all persons”.</li>
    <li>“Zoroaster . . . proclaimed Ahura Mazda to be the one uncreated god, existing eternally”. The attribution of equal power to Angra Mainyu is the Zurvanite heresy, and there is no hint of potential immortality for humans.</li>
    <li>The passage identifies Ahura Mazda as one of these “two primal beings”, which was itself “uncreated”.</li>
    <li>The elevation of Zurvan over Ahura Mazda was the Zurvanite heresy.</li>

  <summary>Question 62</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The argument could not be confirmed by a discovery that is incidental to it.</li>
    <li>The origin of the magi’s concept of time is uncertain and incidental to the author’s argument, which concerns the doctrinal distinctions between Zoroastrians and Zurvanites.</li>
    <li>The argument could not be weakened by a discovery that is incidental to it.</li>
    <li>The argument could not be disproved by a discovery that is incidental to it.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 63</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Although the author states that the concept of history having an end was “one of the most striking elements in the prophet’s teachings” and contrary to “Babylonian speculations about history being divided into great recurrent cycles”, the passage argument does not rest on the assumption that this idea originated with Zoroaster.</li>
    <li>The author does not argue that every Zoroastrian who was not a Zurvanite accepted all of Zoroaster’s assumptions.</li>
    <li>The assertion by Zoroaster that good and evil had a common parent would undermine the author’s argument that this very assertion by the Zurvanites “betrayed Zoroaster’s fundamental doctrine that good and evil . . . are distinct by origin”. The information that the Zurvanites based their interpretation on Zoroaster’s description of the primal forces as “twins” implies that he used the word metaphorically, to indicate the balance of power between these adversaries.</li>
    <li>A prophesy by Zoroaster that his teachings would be distorted would not weaken the author’s argument about the nature of the distortions.</li>

  <summary>Question 64</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage applies specifically to certain pre-Christian middle-Eastern beliefs. Its statements cannot reasonably be generalized to all religions.</li>
    <li>The argument that the one religion discussed had an offshoot that was “a deep and grievous heresy” does not imply that some other religion has maintained wholly consistent doctrines.</li>
    <li>The passage offers information on historical concepts of possible relevance to the magi’s interpretation: “contrasting such theories with Zoroaster’s teachings may well have led them to reflect much on time and its nature”. No attempt is made to justify this or any other interpretation of religious doctrines.</li>
    <li>The passage provides the information that on the basis of their extrapolations from Zoroaster’s scriptures, the Zurvanites defended beliefs that they thought made them “the most truly orthodox followers of Zoroaster”, even though these beliefs “betrayed Zoroaster’s fundamental doctrine”. That is, it indicates that one interpretation of a religious doctrine was inconsistent with another version of that doctrine.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 65</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Since the magi who founded Zurvanism were contemporaries of the Orphic Greeks, and since as scholars, they were familiar with speculations from other cultures, they may well have been influenced by Greek ideas.</li>
    <li>The similarity of Chronos to Zurvan, of Aether to Ahura Mazda, and of Chaos to Angra Mainyu is unlikely to be coincidental, and the correspondence of the dates is consistent with an influence from Iran to Greece.</li>
    <li>Zoroaster “lived between about 1400 and 1200 B.C.”, at least six centuries before the Orphic Greeks, so he cannot have been influenced by them.</li>
    <li>The fact that the Orphic system parallels that of the Zurvanite heresy suggests that Zoroaster, whose writings had almost certainly been translated into Greek in the six centuries since his death, may have been misinterpreted by the Greeks in the same way as by the Iranian magi.</li>
