# Passage 1
In the first place, to make the poem or the novel the central concern of literary criticism has appeared to mean cutting it loose from its author and from the author’s particular hopes, fears, interests, conflicts, etc. A criticism so limited may seem bloodless and hollow.

In the second place, to emphasize the work seems to involve severing it from those who actually read it, and this severance may seem drastic and therefore disastrous. After all, literature is written to be read.

The formalist critic knows as well as anyone that poems and plays and novels are written as expressions of particular personalities and are written from all sorts of motives–for money, from a desire to express oneself, for the sake of a cause, etc. Moreover, the formalist critic knows as well as anyone that literary works are merely potential until they are read–that is, that they are re-created in the minds of actual readers, who vary enormously in their capabilities, their interests, their prejudices, their ideas. But the formalist critic is concerned primarily with the work itself. Speculation on the mental processes of the author takes the critic away from the work into biography and psychology. Such studies describe the process of composition, not the structure of the thing composed.

On the other hand, exploration of the various readings which the work has received also takes the critic away from the work into psychology and the history of taste. But such work, valuable and necessary as it may be, is to be distinguished from a criticism of the work itself. The formalist critic makes two assumptions: (1) that the relevant part of the author’s intention is what the author actually put into the work–that is, the critic assumes that the author’s intention as *realized* is the “intention” that counts. And (2) the formalist critic assumes an ideal reader–that is, instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, the critic attempts to find a central point of reference from which to focus on the structure of the poem or novel.

There is no ideal reader, of course. But for the purpose of focusing on the poem rather than on the critic’s own reactions, it is a defensible strategy. (The alternatives are desperate: Either we say that one person’s reading is as good as another’s, and thus deny the possibility of any standard reading, or else we take the lowest common denominator of the various readings that have been made–that is, we frankly move from literary criticism into social psychology. To propose taking a consensus of the opinions of “qualified” readers is simply to split the ideal reader into a group of ideal readers.) As consequences of the distinction just referred to, the formalist critic rejects two popular tests for literary value. The first proves the value of the work from the author’s “sincerity” (or the intensity of the author’s feelings as he or she composed it). We discount also such tests as the intensity of the critic’s reaction.

A literary work is a document and as a document can be analyzed in terms of the forces that have produced it, or it may be manipulated as a force in its own right. It mirrors the past, it may influence the future. These facts it would be futile to deny, and I know of no critic who does deny them. But the reduction of a work of literature to its causes does not constitute literary criticism; nor does an estimate of its effects. Good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas–even if we could agree upon a philosophical yardstick for measuring the truth of ideas and even if we could find some way that transcended nose counting for determining the effectiveness of the rhetoric.

  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage states that “instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, the [formalist] critic attempts to find a central point of reference from which to focus on the structure of the poem or novel”.</li>
    <li>The passage argues that “speculation on the mental processes of the author [describes] the process of composition, not the structure of the thing composed” and therefore that “the reduction of a work of literature to its causes does not constitute literary criticism”.</li>
    <li>According to the passage, “the formalist critic is concerned primarily with the work itself . . . the structure of the thing composed”.</li>
    <li>The formalist critic’s stated concern with aesthetic criteria (see <i>rationale C</i>) implies less concern with the truthfulness of literary content, as does the assertion that “good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas–even if we could agree upon a philosophical yardstick for measuring the truth of ideas”.</li>

  <summary>Question 9</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The assumption that critical evaluations focused on structural aspects of a work are more valuable than are those focused on its author or its readers is evident in the assertion that “the reduction of a work of literature to its causes does not constitute literary criticism; nor does an estimate of its effects”.</li>
    <li>In defending the decision by formalist critics not to speculate on the mental processes of authors, the passage states that “the formalist critic knows as well as anyone that poems and plays and novels are written as expressions of particular personalities and are written from all sorts of motives”. Neither this statement nor any in the passage suggests that criticism that disregards motivation is ineffective.</li>
    <li>Since the evocation of an ideal reader is only a strategy in the critic’s attempt to focus on the structure of a work rather than on the critic’s personal responses to it, the passage assumes no characteristics of the ideal reader.</li>
    <li>The statement that “good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas” excludes this interpretation.</li>

  <summary>Question 10</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The statement that literary works are merely potential until they are read requires no support; it is a truism that “the formalist critic knows as well as anyone”.</li>
    <li>The conclusion that a literary work can be analyzed in terms of the forces that produced it is presented as self-evident, because it is true of any document.</li>
    <li>The need to evaluate literature from the perspective of an ideal reader, which is presented as one of two premises of formalist criticism, is supported by the argument that the alternatives are either to accept all interpretations as equally valid or to take as correct the most common opinion about a text. The passage author rejects both proposals for avoiding the assumption of an ideal reader as “desperate”–i.e., not true alternatives. The reasoning supporting this conclusion is that the first proposal would in effect simply split the ideal reader into a group of ideal readers, while the second would enter the area of social psychology–i.e., the consensus of responses to a work would reveal more about its readers than about its literary merit.</li>
    <li>No support is offered for the propositions that a literary work mirrors the past and it may influence the future. They are classified as “facts it would be futile to deny, and I know of no critic who does deny them”.</li>

  <summary>Question 11</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author acknowledges that “such work [may be] valuable and necessary”. Implicitly, however, its value and necessity are the responsibility of biographers, historians, and psychologists, not of literary critics (see <i>rationale D</i>).</li>
    <li>According to the passage author, it is the formalist critic for whom the intention as realized–i.e., the finished work–is the only relevant consideration. Conversely, it is the proper role of biography and psychology to consider the intention within the author’s mind.</li>
    <li>The passage asserts that one alternative to an analysis of the poem itself is that “we take the lowest common denominator of the various readings that have been made–that is, we frankly move from literary criticism into social psychology”. This assertion does not reject psychology (biography is not at issue in this regard) because it might study the effects of literature on readers; it rejects this psychological approach for critics because it “does not constitute literary criticism”.</li>
    <li>To use biography in literary criticism would be to consider facts about an author’s life; to use psychology would be to speculate about the inner life of an author or of those who have commented on a literary work. The passage author contends that the application of either of these disciplines to an author is inappropriate for a literary critic because both “describe the process of composition, not the structure of the thing composed”. The argument against a critic’s using psychology to explore the various ways that readers have understood a work is that this investigation, too, “is to be distinguished from a criticism of the work itself”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 12</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage argument for making “the poem or the novel the central concern of literary criticism” indicates that the passage author would disagree with the idea that literary criticism cannot be separated from the study of the people (presumably authors and readers) involved in the artistic transaction.</li>
    <li>The references in this response to historical writing styles and word usage as well as to the interpretation of the author’s intended meaning implicitly assume that these concerns are relevant to literary criticism. The passage author disputes this assumption and therefore would not accept concern over a critic’s interpretive errors due to ignorance of history as a valid issue.</li>
    <li>The declarations that “good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas” and that “the relevant part of the author’s intention is what the author actually put into the work” imply the passage author’s agreement with the proposition that once a piece of language is classified as literature, its author’s intentions are of only peripheral interest.</li>
    <li>The passage indicates that literature includes “poems and plays and novels”, argues that it should be evaluated on the basis of its “structure”, acknowledges that “literary works are merely potential until they are read”, and asserts that “good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas”. Beyond these hints, it does not define the concept <i>literature</i>, so the passage author’s response to the assertion that it is that which is taught in English departments cannot be inferred with justifiable confidence.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 13</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage theme that formalist criticism confines its analyses to the structure of literary works implies the existence of formal criteria that enable critics to distinguish valid from invalid structures.</li>
    <li>The question of whether formalist criticism has the capacity to distinguish possible interpretations of a literary work is meaningless if the passage argument is accepted because this ability is not relevant to criticism. “Instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, the critic attempts to find a central point of reference”.</li>
    <li>The question of whether formalist criticism has the capacity to distinguish authors on the basis of their personalities is meaningless if the passage argument is accepted because this ability is not relevant to criticism. “The formalist critic knows as well as anyone that poems and plays and novels are written as expressions of particular personalities and are written from all sorts of motives [but] speculation on the mental processes of the author takes the critic away from the work into [other disciplines that] describe the process of composition, not the structure of the thing composed”.</li>
    <li>This response is moot for two reasons. First, the <i>effectiveness</i> dimension in literature can refer only to the effect of a work on its readers, not a legitimate concern for critics (see <i>rationale B</i>). Second, the response suggests that the term <i>rhetorical style</i> is equivalent to <i>literary style</i>, a dubious assumption if the passage argument is accepted, since “good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas–even if we could find some way that transcended nose counting for determining the effectiveness of the rhetoric”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 14</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This response is quoted verbatim from the passage statement that “the formalist critic knows as well as anyone that literary works are re-created in the minds of actual readers, who vary enormously in their capabilities, their interests, their prejudices, their ideas”.</li>
    <li>This assertion echoes the words used by the passage author in defending the formalist proposition that attention to either the causes or the effects of literature does not constitute literary criticism: “Good literature is more than effective rhetoric applied to true ideas”.</li>
    <li>The statement that knowledge of the author’s intentions is not usually reliable (implying that such knowledge is possible and sometimes is reliable) does not challenge the passage argument that such knowledge– “even if we could agree upon a philosophical yardstick for measuring the truth of ideas”–is not properly a concern of literary criticism (see <i>rationale D</i>).</li>
    <li>The passage states as a principle of formalist criticism that “the reduction of a work of literature to its causes does not constitute literary criticism”. Therefore a formalist critic does not indulge in “speculation on the mental processes of the author”. The assertion that the social and historical contexts of a work of literature cannot be ignored would directly challenge this principle, since it implies that attention to the social circumstances that formed the author’s mind provides information relevant to the critical analysis of the work of literature.</li>
