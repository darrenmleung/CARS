# Passage 19
During the Puritan Revolution, at least two private groups began to meet regularly in London. One group was centered around John Wallis, a powerful mathematician to whose work, *Arithmetica Infinitorum*, Sir Isaac Newton was indebted for some of his major mathematical conceptions. Those who met with Wallis were interested in astronomy and geometry, and they included Christopher Wren, who was a professor in both subjects. Indeed, Wren's bold architecture was based in part on his geometrical genius. The Royal Society was formally founded in November of 1660 at a meeting in Gresham College which began with a lecture on astronomy by Wren; and the Society went on meeting at Gresham College until 1703.

Wallis's group probably began their weekly meetings in 1645, and about the same time a second group, which centered on Robert Boyle, began to meet. Boyle was a philosopher, a physicist, and a chemist; he revived, although in a form still far short of its modern form, the Epicurean theory that all matter is made of atoms, and he established the law that governs what he called "the spring of the air"—the pressure of a gas—which still goes by his name. Boyle called the group that met with him "The Invisible College."

Both of these groups consisted largely of men of Puritan sympathies. Boyle's family had been on Cromwell's side in the revolution against Charles I; for although they were lords, they were "upstart lords," created by Queen Elizabeth and holding lands that had belonged to the monasteries.

Plainly the temper of the times in England was stronger than the political bias of those in power. Science had a new charm, and scientists had a new prestige. Part of this prestige may have come from their sense of mission and the aura which they were beginning to carry of being dedicated to truth. Most of them were Puritans by birth and came from the families of merchants and smallholders who were thrusting their way into the world. But, intellectually, their Puritanism did give them a special devotion to the honest observation of the world and a grave indifference to the authority of the past, both of which attitudes are still summarized in the word *nonconformist*.

Charles II was a man of some intellectual curiosity, and he took an amateur's interest in science. But he cannot have liked the Puritan scientists who had begun to meet during the Revolution and who numbered among their group many who had risen under Cromwell. It has been estimated that, of the sixty-eight early Fellows of the Royal Society about whom we have information, forty-two were clearly Puritans. Charles II can hardly have been enthusiastic about endorsing a society that was dominated by men whose political and religious views were distasteful to him.

Yet Charles II did give his endorsement to the new society: It was named *The Royal Society of London for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge*, and it received its first charter—and nothing else—from him in 1662. The man who persuaded Charles II to this step was probably the diarist John Evelyn. Evelyn belonged to a smaller group of scientists who had remained Royalists, and the first presidents of the society were drawn from this group. Evelyn himself gave the Royal Society its motto, and he displayed the practical bent of the early fellows in his protests, now over 300 years old, against the smoke that even then fouled the air and withered the plants of London.

  <summary>Question 106</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The passage author never indicates that the lack of royal funding upon receiving the royal charter in 1662 was a barrier to science. The Royal Society endured as witnessed by the fact that “the Society went on meeting at Gresham College until 1703.”</li>
    <li>Although the Puritan Robert Boyle drew on classical theory, namely, Epicurean theory, the Puritans tended to display “a grave indifference to the authority of the past” in favor of “honest observation.”</li>
    <li>The passage does not discuss Puritan renunciation of worldly interests, but at any rate, Puritanism encouraged rather than discouraged scientific pursuits. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>Many scientists, including a majority of the early Fellows in the Royal Society, were Puritans. The passage author implies there is a relationship between scientific inquiry and the search for truth by commenting that “intellectually, [the scientists’] Puritanism did give them a special devotion to the honest observation of the world and a grave indifference to the authority of the past.”</li>

  <summary>Question 107</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This represents the most direct challenge to the claim in the passage that, for Puritan scientists, “intellectually, [the scientists’] Puritanism did give them a special devotion to the honest observation of the world and a grave indifference to the authority of the past, both of which attitudes are still summarized in the word <i>nonconformist</i>.”</li>
    <li>The passage author observes that Puritans displayed indifference to the authority of the past. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The passage author suggests that Puritan scientists pursued truth rather than followed their leaders or any leaders: “Plainly the temper of the times in England was stronger than the political bias of those in power. Science had a new charm, and scientists had a new prestige. Part of this prestige may have come from their sense of mission and the aura which they were beginning to carry of being dedicated to truth.”</li>
    <li>Passage information shows that many of these Puritan scientists came from merchant families, so the fact that most Puritans engaged in commerce would not challenge the passage author’s characterization of Puritans.</li>

  <summary>Question 108</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This information at best would account for the attitude of Charles II, not provide evidence of it.</li>
    <li>Charles II’s amateur interest in science may have accounted for why he granted the charter, but this interest does not provide evidence of his attitude, which is that he granted the charter and nothing else. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>This may actually account for why Charles II granted the charter, but it does not reveal his attitude. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The passage author observes that “Charles II can hardly have been enthusiastic about endorsing a society that was dominated by men whose political and religious views were distasteful to him.” The passage author follows up this observation with the following evidence: “Yet Charles II did give his endorsement to the new society . . . and it received its first charter—and nothing else—from him in 1662.”</li>

  <summary>Question 109</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>This analogy suggests that the founders of the Royal Society, because they were predominantly Puritan, were an irritant to Charles II, which is supported by the following: “Charles II was a man of some intellectual curiosity, and he took an amateur’s interest in science. But he cannot have liked the Puritan scientists who had begun to meet during the Revolution and who numbered among their group many who had risen under Cromwell.”</li>
    <li>This analogy may suggest that, intellectually, Charles II represented an out-of-date worldview, given that pterodactyls were extinct and birds have succeeded them. However, this analogy is not supported by the passage information that “Charles II was a man of some intellectual curiosity, and he took an amateur’s interest in science.”</li>
    <li>This analogy would suggest that Charles II preyed on the founders of the Royal Society or that he was a threat to them, but passage information suggests that he was not, given that he gave his endorsement to the Society.</li>
    <li>This analogy would suggest that members of the Royal Society were a threat to Charles II and that he may have tried to avoid them; instead, he gave the Society his endorsement even though he did not fund them.</li>

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Wallis’s group focused on astronomy and geometry. Boyle was a physicist, philosopher, and chemist who revived Epicurean atomic theory and established Boyle’s law, which governs gas pressure. Neither group, according to passage information, presented papers foretelling events through astrology.</li>
    <li>Neither group presented papers on this subject. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
