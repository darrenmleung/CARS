# Passage 9
Knowledge structures called memory schemas have become very important in theories of human learning and thinking. Schemas are organized knowledge structures in memory that can be thought of as generic concepts representing objects, persons, situations, events, sequences of events, actions, or sequences of actions.

A memory schema is activated when information similar to its content is processed by the cognitive system. Once activated, the schema influences the processing of the new information and provides a mental context for it. If the information is similar enough to the content of the schema, then it is judged an instance of what the schema represents. The schema is thus instantiated by the new information. For example, if a person sees only an eye and a nose in a picture, with other facial features in shadow and not visible, the person may infer on the basis of this partial information that he or she should look for a face. This example assumes, of course, that the eye and nose have the correct orientation and the correct relative position.

There is a special type of schema called a script that not only aids in comprehending and remembering information but also helps guide behavior. For example, when a person is eating in a restaurant, the restaurant script activated in memory enables the person not only to expect certain events (such as being shown a table and being approached by a waiter) but also initiates behavior (such as ordering and paying).

If a person reading a passage comes upon the sentence “John was hungry, so he entered a restaurant,” the restaurant script is activated in memory. The advantage of having this active script available to the reader is that it provides general information about restaurants. However, specific information about this particular restaurant event must be selected from the passage as an instance of the script. If the next sentence is “John sat down near the door and gave his order to Paul,” then the generic script allows the reader to infer that John sat down at a table in a particular location and gave his order to someone named Paul who was a waiter. This process is called slot filling because information specific to the restaurant event being read is stored in memory as values for the particular actions, roles, and props involved in the restaurant script. The script is being instantiated. The table involved is one near the restaurant door, and the waiter involved is Paul. Other information not explicitly mentioned in the passage can be inferred on the basis of what is stored in the generic script. For example, the reader may infer that the restaurant gave John a napkin to use and that the color of the napkin was white.

If the reader later tries to remember the information read, the restaurant script is again activated and enables the restaurant event described in the passage to be remembered. The slots of the schema contain the information placed there during its most recent activation, although this information is not retained perfectly. Some forgetting may occur. Other types of recall errors can also occur. Because many inferences are made during schema-based comprehension, some information may be recalled that was never presented. These inferences often cannot be discriminated by the learner from the information presented.

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 55</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Schema theory provides no basis for determining the accuracy of memories—on the contrary, it postulates inferences made during comprehension that “often cannot be discriminated by the learner from the information presented”.</li>
    <li>Schema theory concerns the way a concept derived from prior experience “influences the processing of [similar] new information and provides a mental context for it”, a basic issue for the study of thinking and learning.</li>
    <li>Although the passage asserts that with frequently activated schemas, “some forgetting may occur” and suggests that the forgotten details had been superceded in the slots of a schema by “the information placed there during its most recent activation”, it does not suggest that schema theory can explain the forgetting of important information.</li>
    <li>“A memory schema is activated” not when the information being processed indicates an unfamiliar situation but “when information similar to its content is processed by the cognitive system”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 56</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A script is “a special kind of schema” and is therefore “activated when information similar to its content is processed”. The ability to process a particular event with reference to knowledge about that general type of event means that each new instance is at least partially already known.</li>
    <li>Veridical memory is not assumed: Not only does a memory contain information that was inferred on the basis of past events rather than experienced during the particular episode but even information specific to this episode “is not retained perfectly”.</li>
    <li>The purpose of the script construct is precisely to explain the facility with which one recognizes and responds to new instances of frequently experienced general situations.</li>
    <li>This discussion of scripts begins with the assertion that they help “guide behavior”. This assertion is elaborated by the example of “the restaurant script,” which, because it is activated during new instances of an already experienced situation, enables one to expect to be shown a table and be approached by a waiter as well as to order and to pay for food.</li>

  <summary>Question 57</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Inferences occur as the knowledge represented in schemas is applied to new information; there is no reason to suppose that they can arise independently. Differential recall of a literary work indicates only that the schemas it activates, and therefore inferences about its details, differ among readers.</li>
    <li>Although the description of scripts as schemas, which are “organized knowledge structures,” and “generic concepts”, as well as the comprehensiveness of “the restaurant script” example, implies that scripts are necessarily activated as a unit, the differential recall of a literary work is not evidence of this unity. It could equally well indicate that scripts are collections of specific information about various instances, since details recalled on the basis of the partially activated scripts of various readers would be unlikely to agree.</li>
    <li>Although presumably instantiation is a subconscious process, a disparity among readers in their recall of literary material does not imply that they were unaware of the knowledge activated during its comprehension.</li>
    <li>To the extent that the readers understood the literary work, it must have referred to concepts familiar to them, so they evidently activated memory schemas as they read. The readers’ discrepancies in recall suggest that the schemas of some or all of them modified specific details of the text, supporting the assertion that recall errors are a normal feature of schema-based comprehension.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 58</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>There is no suggestion in the description of script activation that it occurs as the result of a deliberate effort.</li>
    <li>Script activation is described in terms of a restaurant situation, in which the script “guides behavior,” by enabling one “to expect certain events”. Since the knowledge that constitutes a script can only have been acquired through learning, the author’s description implies that behavior is guided by prior knowledge.</li>
    <li>Slot filling is described as the storage in memory of “information specific to” the ongoing event—e.g., “a table in a particular location,” a waiter “named Paul”.</li>
    <li>The description of script activation refers to inferences from a generic script that allow the interpretation of a particular new event, supporting the conclusion that inferences are a necessary aspect of the cognitive processing of new information. To say that inferencing depends on this processing falsely implies that they are separate, sequential events.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 59</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>By definition, a <i>schema</i> is already in memory, since it is a generic concept evidently derived from multiple specific experiences. The concept of a <i>new schema</i> is therefore meaningless. In any case, since instantiation is the recognition of specific information as an instance of a general concept, the appropriate question would be whether the new information had the defining features of a schema, not just whether they contained elements in common.</li>
    <li>Since schemas are hypothetical constructs, not observable entities, neither its alteration nor its instantiation would be apparent. The problem with <i>response B</i> is that it assumes the knowledge that is in question: the criterion for judging whether a mental process has occurred.</li>
    <li>To infer instantiation from activation would be to assume that a schema can be activated only in response to an instance of it, an assumption not justified by the passage. There is also no reason to assume that schema activation is a function of the quantity rather than the quality of information. Furthermore, even if schema activation did depend on a critical level of information, this amount would be unknowable because information does not occur in uniformly quantifiable units and because schema activation is not observable.</li>
    <li>Instantiation occurs when new information is similar enough in content to a schema to be judged an instance of it. Therefore a researcher could not assume that instantiation had occurred unless information presented to a perceiver fit—i.e., was clearly an example of—a schema known to be represented in the perceiver’s memory.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 60</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A teacher who understood schema theory would know that children’s reading comprehension depends on the contextual knowledge activated by the text and would therefore stress the acquisition of this knowledge.</li>
    <li>The passage relates schema theory to comprehension and memory, factors presumably more important to a reading instructor than is pronunciation.</li>
    <li>Rote memorization does not depend on understanding and thus would be unlikely to activate the “organized knowledge structures in memory” that would guide reading comprehension.</li>
    <li>Although explanations of unfamiliar words would be intended to activate the appropriate schemas, thereby promoting reading comprehension, the children’s understanding of these explanations would itself depend on their possession of prior knowledge.</li>
