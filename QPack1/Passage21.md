# Passage 21
The residents of Sun City, Leisure World, and retirement communities across the United States live on a frontier-not a geographical but a chronological frontier. Old age is hardly new, but for an entire generation to reach old age with its membership almost intact is new. Until relatively recently, death had no more relation to old age than to any other period of life-in fact, it had less.

A quarter of the people born in seventeenth-century France died during their first year, another quarter died before the age of twenty, and a third quarter died by age forty-five; only 10 percent reached sixty. From the seventeenth century to the nineteenth, the percentage of the French population over sixty remained constant at 8.8 percent.

In the last hundred years, the demographics of mortality have changed more than in the six previous centuries. In 1900, the average life expectancy for U.S. children was 47.3 years. In 1980, it was 73.6 years. This startling increase was due mainly to success in reducing infant, childhood, and maternal mortality. In addition-also because of medical advances-longevity increased. In 1900, white males of sixty could expect 14.4 more years of life. In 1978, they could expect to live 17.2 more years. As a result of these and other changes, the number of Americans over sixty-five increased both absolutely and relative to the entire population. In 1900, 4 percent of the population was over sixty-five. In 1980, 25.5 million Americans, or 11.3 percent, were in this age group.

Before World War II, there were no age-segregated communities and there was no such concept as “retirement living.” In the early 1960s, when credit and housing materials were relatively cheap, developers began to construct complete towns for the retired. Lured by glossy advertisements depicting a life of warm friendships and endless pleasures, many retirees welcomed these complexes as a new adventure. In the mid-1970s, while housing costs doubled and trebled, the developers grew leery of such grand schemes, but by that time there were, according to one estimate, sixty-nine retirement villages, many with over ten thousand inhabitants. Mobile-home parks for the elderly also proliferated during this period along with other forms of age-dedicated housing, from retirement hotels to luxury condominiums. The most original of these innovations was the “life-care facility,” which offered small private living quarters, maid service, nursing care, and meals, as well as nursing-home care when necessary.

Gerontologists struggling to create a taxonomy for these new forms of housing estimate that 5 percent of Americans over sixty-five now live in explicitly age-segregated facilities and another unknown but significant percentage live in neighborhoods that are more or less age segregated. These locales are not just places in which the elderly happen to find each other, as they do in certain rural enclaves and inner-city neighborhoods after everyone else has left. They are not only deliberate creations-places to which retired persons have moved by choice-but most of them have now evolved from mere developers’ tracts into communities with traditions of their own.

The construction of retirement villages initiated a great debate among gerontologists. In the 1960s, opinion was generally against this innovation. City planners and journalists joined the professionals in attacking communities for retirees as ghettos for marginalized, alienated people or as playgrounds that trivialized the aged. But after visiting the residents of these villages with scientific sampling methods and attitudinal charts, many gerontologists concluded that the elderly found in their segregated lives the advantages overtly and subliminally advertised in the real-estate brochures.

# Questions
### 116. A resident of seventeenth-century France who died at age forty began having children at age twenty. What percentage of the children would be expected to die before this parent?
<ol type="A">
  <li>10 percent</li>
  <li>25 percent</li>
  <li>50 percent</li>
  <li>70 percent</li>
</ol>

### 117. The assertion that death had less relation to old age than to other periods of life most clearly suggests that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>the increase in life expectancy has more to do with health in early life than in late life.</li>
  <li>people in pre-industrial cultures felt less attachment to their infants than people do now.</li>
  <li>people today are more concerned with long-term planning than were earlier generations.</li>
  <li>the elderly are less respected than in the past because longevity is commonplace.</li>
</ol>

### 118. New arrivals at one retirement community were told by its director: “You are like pilgrims crossing the ocean to take up a new life.” This simile implicitly supports the author’s assumption that those moving to retirement communities feel:
<ol type="A">
  <li>ambivalence about the wisdom of breaking with the past.</li>
  <li>satisfaction at becoming independent of their families.</li>
  <li>relief at leaving situations that had become difficult.</li>
  <li>optimism about being among those with similar goals.</li>
</ol>

### 119. What is the author’s probable reason for prefacing the discussion of a twentieth-century U.S. phenomenon with information about the demographics of seventeenth-century France?
<ol type="A">
  <li>To clarify the relationship between life expectancy and the decision to change residences in old age</li>
  <li>To counter the prevalent belief that demographic changes have been unique to the U.S. culture</li>
  <li>To support the argument that the current rate of survival into old age is unprecedented</li>
  <li>To show the historical antecedents of the ongoing trend toward increased longevity</li>
</ol>

### 120. According to the passage, an American born in 1980 could expect to live 26.3 years longer than one born in 1900. Yet a white male of sixty could expect to live only 2.8 years longer in 1978 than in 1900. The difference in these expectancies can be explained as:
<ol type="A">
  <li>the cumulative effect of the growing number of elderly.</li>
  <li>evidence that geriatric care has improved since 1978.</li>
  <li>a result of the longer life span of women than of men.</li>
  <li>the difference between longevity and life expectancy.</li>
</ol>

  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>
    <li>The author cites the following mortality figures: “A quarter of the people born in seventeenth-century France died during their first year, another quarter died before the age of twenty, and a third quarter died by the age of forty-five. . . .” Therefore, it follows that a person who lived to age forty and began having children at age twenty could see 50 percent of these children die.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale C</i>.</li>

<details>
  <summary>Question 117</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author notes that 75 percent of all people who died did so by age 45. The author further notes that by 1980 average life expectancy was 73.6 years, which “was mainly due to success in reducing infant, childhood, and maternal mortality.” To put it another way, many more people now live past age 60, which is why the association of death with old age has become a recent phenomenon.</li>
    <li>Nowhere in the passage does the author link this idea to people feeling less attached to their infants in pre-Industrial cultures than people do now. Nor is this relationship as clear as the relationship between mortality and health in earlier age, which is the clearest relationship. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>Nowhere in the passage does the author assert that people now are more concerned with long-range planning than earlier generations, although concern with long-range planning would be a logical result of more people living to, and dying in, old age. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The author does not make an issue of less respect for the elderly or relate that to longevity being more commonplace now. The relationship is not clear between less respect for the elderly and greater longevity whereas the relationship between greater longevity and health earlier in life is much more clear and logical. See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 118</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author does not refer to this ambivalence nor does the director’s statement reflect it.</li>
    <li>The author does not refer to elderly persons’ sense of satisfaction at being independent of their families. The elderly were looking for a sense of community, friendship, and a life of ease. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The author makes no reference to the elderly leaving situations that had become difficult or looking for relief from these situations. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The author states that advertisements for retirement living made promises of the good life and reflected a sense of optimism and common goals: “Lured by glossy advertisements depicting a life of warm friendships and endless pleasures, many retirees welcomed these new complexes as a new adventure.” The author later notes that surveys of elderly showed that these promises largely proved to be true as the elderly found the friendship and leisure in these retirement communities that was advertised. Therefore, the director’s statement supports the optimistic assumptions made by the author and the fact that many retirement communities have “evolved from mere developers’ tracts into communities with traditions of their own.”</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 119</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The decision to change residences had much to do with developers building and advertising retirement communities. It does not logically follow that the comparison between mortality rates in seventeenth-century France and the present-day U.S. would do as much as the development of retirement communities to clarify the relationship between life expectancy and the decision to change residences.</li>
    <li>This comparison does not counter this belief, but supports it—unprecedented numbers of people are living into old age. For a long period the number of people living past sixty held fairly constant—from seventeenth-century France to nineteenth century France only 8.8 percent lived past age sixty.</li>
    <li>The emphasis in the passage is that the current rate of longevity is unprecedented and that the comparison between now and seventeenth-century France documented this. The author’s thesis is that the appearance of retirement communities is a kind of frontier: “Old age is hardly new, but for an entire generation to reach old age with its membership almost intact is new.” This comparison supports that thesis.</li>
    <li>Up through 1900 there was no marked increase toward greater life expectancy. The average life expectancy for children in the U.S. was 47.3 years; in 1980 it was 73.6 years. The author sees not so much an on-going trend as a sudden jump in life expectancy: “In 1900 4 percent of the population was over 65. In 1980,. . . 11.3 percent were in this age group.”</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 120</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The jump in life expectancy statistics, not longevity, is a result of the cumulative effect of the growing number of elderly. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>This is not evidence that geriatric care has improved <i>since</i> 1978, because the comparison discussed is between 1900 and 1978, not beyond.</li>
    <li>The longer life span of women would figure into longevity statistics, not life expectancy statistics. The life span of women is not relevant in this case, anyway, since the longevity expectations being discussed are those of white males. See <i>rationale D</i>.</li>
    <li>The author, in discussing longevity, shows that people are not living appreciably longer in actual years but that more people are living into old age and that life expectancy depends on health in earlier years. This statistic underscores this crucial difference between life expectancy, which has increased dramatically, and longevity, which has increased comparatively little.</li>
