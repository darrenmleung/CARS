# Passage 18
As the national government has reordered its economic priorities, state and local governments have become more innovative and active vis-à-vis their economies. The characteristic that distinguishes state and local economic development activity is competitiveness. Nonnational governments are awash in competition for economic development, primarily for a structural reason: A fragmented federal system fosters interjurisdictional competition. More that 82 percent of influential local officials in Southeastern cities termed the economic development environment “very competitive” in a survey conducted in l986.

State and local governments have reacted to this situation by taking actions intended to make themselves more attractive to new and relocating enterprises. If a business firm is unhappy with conditions in a community, it may seek a new location, and it is likely to find other communities waiting with open arms. When the Mack Truck Company announced its intention to relocate its manufacturing facility from Allentown, Pennsylvania, it had an array of communities from which to choose. To make themselves more enticing, the beckoning jurisdictions (and their state governments) offered a panoply of incentives, including property tax abatements, below-cost land, infrastructure, and training programs for potential employees. Mack Truck decided to relocate to South Carolina.

Economic competition is most apparent when the stakes are high—that is, when the location decision will mean a substantial number of jobs, as in the case of General Motors’ Saturn plant. State after state lined up to offer General Motors generous packages of financial incentives, promising an assortment of tax breaks, access roads, water and sewer systems, and employee training. The eventual winner was Tennessee.

There is a great deal of debate about the effect of interjurisdictional competition. As we noted earlier, incentives and concessions amount to a giveaway to business. Critics claim that competition for economic development is nothing more than the relocation of a given amount of economic activity from one community to another, with no overall increase in national productivity. The solution, they argue, is increased cooperation. However, this is elusive. For example, governors of the Great Lakes states have been unsuccessful in establishing a “no pirating” pact within the region.

Counties have found cooperation challenging, too. A National Association of Counties study of urban counties reported that only 5 percent frequently coordinated their economic development activities with other counties. Only slightly more (19 percent) indicated frequent coordination with cities located within their boundaries. Economic development has tended to be a singular proposition, with each jurisdiction pursuing its own destiny.

This can be destructive to the jurisdictions involved. For example, the State Development Board in South Carolina, an agency devoted to promoting the state as a place for investment, has encouraged rural counties to band together and pursue a united economic development effort. But the board’s encouragement does not square with political realities. Lingering rivalries between adjacent counties effectively blunt efforts at cooperation. Further, while the board advocates intrastate cooperation, it explicitly engages in interstate competition: The reason that South Carolina counties should work together, it argues, is to become stronger competitors against North Carolina counties. Competition continues, but in a different arena.

Economic conditions may ultimately serve as the catalyst for greater cooperation among jurisdictions. This is exactly what has occurred in the Monongahela River Valley area. This 7,400-square-mile section of southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and western Maryland has found that the markets for its products and traditional sources of investment are drying up. Individual jurisdictions have realized that the economic problems are too big for them to solve alone; the troubled economies of the cities and counties are symptoms of a region-wide malaise. After a series of false starts, local leaders have journeyed across county and state boundaries to develop a coordinated agenda for economic revival.

  <summary>Question 101</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Governmental competition is not compared with private competition.</li>
    <li>Governmental efficiency is not mentioned, and there is no suggestion that competition increases it.</li>
    <li>The passage presents the direction of influence as from the national to the subnational units, not vice versa: “A fragmented federal system fosters interjurisdictional competition”.</li>
    <li>The argument that competition for economic development results in “no overall increase in national productivity” and that the solution is “increased cooperation” is implicitly endorsed in the final paragraph, which indicates approval of cooperation “across county and state boundaries”.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 102</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>A federal system characterized as “fragmented” is said to foster “interjurisdictional competition”, implying that national officials are unlikely to provide leadership for interjurisdictional cooperation.</li>
    <li>Some city officials are termed “influential”, a state agency “has encouraged rural counties to band together and pursue a united economic development effort”, and successful cooperation has apparently occurred because “local leaders have journeyed across county and state boundaries to develop a coordinated agenda for economic revival”. These indications of the power of local leaders show them to be appropriately placed to foster cooperation.</li>
    <li>There is no indication that academicians were involved in the statistical studies mentioned—“a survey” and a “National Association of Counties study”—or that this research or those who conducted it took a position favoring cooperation.</li>
    <li>Media representatives, although possibly involved in the “debate” and possibly among the “critics” of competition, are not mentioned.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 103</summary>
    <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>Since the Monongahela River Valley area prospered because of “greater cooperation”, while the 95 percent of counties that seldom cooperate were presumably affected by the hypothesized general economic downturn, these jurisdictions would not be justified in intensifying their competition.</li>
    <li>For the reason given in <i>rationale A</i>, local jurisdictions should not conclude that their usual (high) level of competition was a wise course.</li>
    <li>The author speculates that “economic conditions may ultimately serve as the catalyst for greater cooperation among jurisdictions”. This question refers to “times of general economic downturn,” which would constitute such a catalyst for local jurisdictions. The lesson for these jurisdictions of a decade of prosperity in an area that was also in economic decline until it implemented “a coordinated agenda for economic revival” would be that they, too, should increase their cooperation.</li>
    <li>The word “additional” in <i>response D</i> indicates that federal agencies had already supplied grants that were presumably applied to competition. Local administrators would be unlikely to solicit funds for a policy that had already failed them (as indicated by the economic downturn), especially since they could observe sustained prosperity due to cooperation in the Monongahela River Valley.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Question 104</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The statistics provided indicate that economic cooperation, although rare, does occur.</li>
    <li>There is no suggestion that cities or counties are ever legally required to cooperate.</li>
    <li>The cooperation followed an economic improvement, a sequence inconsistent with the causal relationship suggested—that a faltering economy may be “the catalyst for greater cooperation,” as in the example provided.</li>
    <li>The example of the Monongahela River Valley area involves cooperation across “state boundaries”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 105</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The information that “governors of the Great Lakes states have been unsuccessful in establishing a ‘no pirating’ pact within the region” is presented as an example of the elusiveness of the goal of cooperation among communities. Implicitly, the example is meant to indicate a more general failure of state governments to control competition among local governments.</li>
    <li>Except for the Great Lakes pact, the only indication of any state-level discouragement of local economic competition is that the South Carolina State Development Board has encouraged rural counties to cooperate. This encouragement has apparently failed: “Lingering rivalries between adjacent counties effectively blunt efforts at cooperation”.</li>
    <li>There is no suggestion that local governments have more successfully controlled competition than have state governments. The passage implies rather that local governments not only engage in interjurisdictional competition but promote their state in competition with other states, as occurred with the relocation of Mack Truck Company.</li>
    <li>The passage provides no reason to conclude that the national government can directly regulate economic competition among local governments.</li>
