# Passage 1
From 1890, when he was nine, Picasso’s family saved virtually every scrap of paper on which he drew. Harbingers of Picasso’s later genius appear in fragmented and distorted aspects of form and scale, depictions garlanded by numerical and alphabetical symbols, a proliferation of *trompe l’oeil*, visual puns, outrageous caricatures, incongruous juxtapositions, and the like. We do not know whether Picasso consciously thought back to these graphic experiments when, two decades later, he and Georges Braque were inventing cubism, but at least at an unconscious level, Picasso could tap this reservoir of youthful experimentation.

The standard story told of Picasso is that his precocious talent enabled him to surpass, without effort, all other artists in his milieu. It is worth considering Picasso’s own opinion that what is often considered early genius is actually the naïveté of childhood. “It disappears at a certain age without leaving traces.” It is possible that a young child who shows unusual flair will one day become an artist, but he or she “will have to begin again from the beginning. I did not have this genius. For example, my first drawings could not have been hung in a display of children’s work. These pictures lacked childlikeness. . . . At a youthful age I painted in a quite academic way, so literal and precise that I am shocked today.” At an exhibition of children’s art, Picasso once quipped, “When I was their age, I could draw like Raphael, but it has taken me a whole lifetime to learn to draw like them.”

In such remarks, Picasso exalted children’s productions but also distanced his youthful self from the romantic view of artistic talent. It is true that the works preserved by Picasso’s family support the notion of Picasso as an aspiring academic painter (as his father was) and not as a charming naïf. However, we lack drawings by Picasso from his first eight years and so cannot determine the resemblance of his earliest efforts to those of other children. Moreover, his youthful caprices and marginalia may have been as crucial in his artistic development as his formally conceived early paintings. My own conclusion is that Picasso’s output during the first decade of his life was unusually skilled rather than frankly precocious but that no word short of *prodigy* can describe him in his spectacular progress over the next several years.

Apollinaire asserted that there were two kinds of artists: the unreflective virtuoso, who relies on nature, and the cerebral structurer, who relies on understanding. Mozart could serve as prototype for the first, Beethoven for the second. As a prodigy, Picasso epitomized the second type, but, said Apollinaire, he was able to convert himself into the first. “Never has there been so fantastic a spectacle as the metamorphosis he underwent in becoming an artist of the first type.” Picasso himself sensed the paradox of this transformation when he complained to Gertrude Stein, “If I can draw as well as Raphael, I have at least the right to choose my way, and they should recognize that right, but no, they say no.”

The *Portrait of Gertrude Stein* (1906) stands out as an indicator of this transformation: Picasso asked his subject to remain for over eighty sittings. Then he went away for the summer, annihilated the recognizable facial features, and finished the portrait away from Stein, substituting masklike features for realistic ones. (Chastised because the portrait did not look like Stein, Picasso reportedly responded with one of the notable artistic one-liners of the century: “Don’t worry, it will.”)

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 1</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The author disputes the “standard story” that Picasso’s genius was an effortless holdover from childhood and points out the lack of evidence that he was ever “a charming naïf”, concluding instead that he was “unusually skilled” during his first decade.</li>
    <li>The author does not imply that Picasso rejected artistic conventions (rather than that he used them in original ways). The fact that he took “over eighty sittings” to determine his approach to one portrait indicates a deliberate striving for a vision of his own, not a negative reaction to the art of others.</li>
    <li>The passage extols Picasso’s achievements as artistic, not painstaking—the result of originality, not of a systematic approach. His preliminary work on the <i>Portrait of Gertrude Stein</i> is discussed because it “stands out as an indicator of [his] transformation”. Furthermore, his final version did not revise his initial attempts: He “annihilated the recognizable facial features, and finished the portrait away from Stein”.</li>
    <li>In referring to “this transformation”, the author implicitly accepts Apollinaire’s judgment that Picasso “was able to convert himself into the first type of artist”, an “unreflective virtuoso”, by consciously acquiring a childlike style. That is, the author attributes Picasso’s artistic achievements to his success in learning “to draw like [children]”.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Question 2</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The reference is to artists of a certain kind, not to a restriction on the subject matter of these artists.</li>
    <li>In describing an artist who relies on nature as a “virtuoso,” Apollinaire indicates that this artist is a master of aesthetic principles—i.e., the artist’s understanding is not elementary. It is the description of the virtuosity as “unreflective” that indicates the intended meaning of <i>nature.</i></li>
    <li>The information in the line cited, that it is the “unreflective virtuoso” who relies on nature, indicates that <i>nature</i>, in Apollinaire’s usage, refers to the artist’s own creative nature, an intuitive artistic mastery.</li>
    <li>Implicitly, the creations of an artist described as a “virtuoso” are not expressions of uncontrolled impulses. The term “relies on nature” indicates only that the artistic control is intuitive rather than learned.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 3</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>D</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The conclusion that Picasso’s early output was “unusually skilled” is based solely on productions from his ninth year, not on descriptions of early drawings, which no longer exist, and the author’s point is that unusual skill is not genius. Furthermore, the endorsement of Picasso’s own assessment of early genius, which he reports that he “did not have” implies the author’s agreement with it. The progress described as “spectacular” did not occur until Picasso’s second decade, when his work presents him “as an aspiring academic painter . . . not as a charming naïf”. All of this evidence opposes the standard story (see <i>rationale D</i>).</li>
    <li>Although the reference to the standard story precedes the discussion of Picasso’s eventual virtuosity, its function in the passage is not simply introductory. The author’s lack of neutrality about this story is evident in the contradictory information provided throughout the passage—e.g., in the references to a “transformation”.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>The author’s skepticism about the assumption that Picasso’s mature style was simply the uninterrupted extension of a childhood precocity is explicit: “My own conclusion is that Picasso’s output during the first decade of his life was unusually skilled rather than frankly precocious but that no word short of <i>prodigy</i> can describe him in his spectacular progress over the next several years”.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 4</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>A</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>According to Picasso, “my first drawings . . . lacked childlikeness” and were “literal and precise”. According to the author, <i>The Portrait of Gertrude Stein</i>, which is not realistic, is “an indicator” of the transformation that occurred in Picasso’s work. Therefore, the assertion that Picasso’s early productions contain harbingers of his later art is not obviously consistent with Picasso’s own description of these productions.</li>
    <li>Part of the author’s reason for this assertion is “fragmented and distorted aspects of form and scale” in his youthful experiments that seem to prefigure cubism, which he and Braque invented “two decades later”.</li>
    <li>An absence of something implies nothing about its nature, and the assertion is justified by Picasso’s drawings from the age of nine (see <i>rationale B</i>).</li>
    <li>Picasso’s early drawings included “a proliferation of <i>trompe l'oeil</i>, visual puns, outrageous caricatures, incongruous juxtapositions, and the like”. The author cites this graphic playfulness as evidence that Picasso’s early productions herald his later genius, when he had learned to draw with childlike charm.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 5</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>In characterizing the objects incorporated in Picasso’s sculptures as “surprising” and in putting the term <i>found objects</i> in quotation marks, this response implies a sophisticated selectivity that would not suggest the productions of a young child.</li>
    <li>In referring to the muted colors and elongated figures of Picasso’s blue period, this response indicates that they were carefully and subtly rendered, not like the boldness of children’s paintings.</li>
    <li>Picasso’s goals are implied in his assertion “it has taken me a lifetime to learn to draw like them”. The childlike directness and flair to which he aspired is most clearly exemplified in plates on which he painted bold, colorful facial features.</li>
    <li>Monochromy, hard edges, and multifaceted perspectives suggest the invented style of cubism rather than the spontaneity of children’s art.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 6</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>B</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The reader can infer from the context that the drawings of Raphael are delicate and precise. Picasso’s remark that his childhood drawings resembled Raphael’s, if true, would therefore imply that he was originally an artist of Apollinaire’s second type, a “cerebral structurer”.</li>
    <li>Despite the author’s endorsement of the belief of both Picasso and Apollinaire that Picasso deliberately converted himself into an “unreflective virtuoso”, the early “proliferation” of exuberant, apparently improvisational, graphic experiments could encourage the speculation that he had always been an artist of this type.</li>
    <li>See <i>rationale A</i>.</li>
    <li>Picasso was 25 when he painted Stein’s portrait. His approach to it is presented as a break from the literal style of his youth.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 7</summary>
  <b>Solution</b>: The correct answer is <b>C</b>.
  
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Afocus on Stein’s facial details, either as they appeared during the sittings or as they might appear later, would not reflect the aims attributed to Picasso (see <i>rationale C</i>).</li>
    <li>The portrait was “finished.” Furthermore, since Picasso finished the final version “away from Stein”, superficial accuracy could not have been his goal.</li>
    <li>The characterization of Picasso’s artistic aims as a rejection of academic literalism in favor of the expressive directness of childhood suggests that his response to detractors was an affirmation of his achievement of this aim. That is, he meant to suggest that the criticism was misguided in focusing on a literal likeness rather than the essence of the sitter, and that once the critics had changed their perspective, they would see that the portrait did in this sense look like Stein.</li>
    <li>Picasso’s retort, while implying that viewers who appreciate his portraits will see them in a new way, does not suggest that this way is analytic. The author’s characterization of Picasso’s artistic aims instead suggests that a less cerebral, more intuitive responsiveness to his paintings is appropriate (see <i>rationale C</i>).</li>
