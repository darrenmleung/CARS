# Passage 16
The most remarkable thing about prehistoric naturalism is not that it is older than the geometric style, which makes so much more of a primitive impression, but that it already reveals all the typical phases of development through which art has passed in modern times and is not in any sense the merely instinctive, static phenomenon that scholars obsessed with geometric and rigorously formal art declare it to be.

There are no parallels whatever between this prehistoric art and child art. Children's drawings are rationalistic, not sensory: They show what the child and the adult artist know, not what they actually see; they give a theoretically synthetic, not an optically organic, picture of the object.

The peculiar thing about the naturalistic drawings of the Old Stone Age is, on the other hand, that they give the visual impression in such a direct, unmixed form, free from all intellectual trimmings or restrictions. The painters of the Paleolithic Age were still able to see delicate shades with the naked eye that modern people are able to discover only with the help of complicated scientific instruments.

What was the purpose behind this art? Was it the expression of a joy of life insistent on being recorded and repeated? Or the satisfaction of the play instinct and delight in embellishment? Was it the fruit of leisure, or had it some definite practical purpose? Have we to see in it a plaything or a tool in the struggle for a livelihood? We know that it was the art of primitive hunters living on an unproductive, parasitic economic level, who had to gather or capture their food rather than produce it themselves, who to all appearances still lived at the stage of primitive individualism in unstable, almost entirely unorganized social patterns, in small isolated hordes, and who believed in no gods, in no world and life beyond death.

In this age of purely practical life, everything obviously still turned around the bare earning of a livelihood, and there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served any other purpose than a means to the procuring of food. All the indications point rather to the fact that it was the instrument of a magical technique and, as such, had a thoroughly pragmatic function aimed entirely at direct economic objectives. It was a technique without mystery, a matter-of-fact procedure, the objective application of methods that had as little to do with mysticism and esoterism as when we set mousetraps, manure the ground, or take a drug.

The pictures were part of the technical apparatus of this magic; they were the "trap" into which the game had to go—or rather, they were the trap with the already captured animal—for the picture was both representation and the things represented, both wish and wish fulfillment, at one and the same time. The paleolithic hunter and painter felt in possession of the thing itself in the picture, felt power over the object in the portrayal of the object. The hunter believed the real animal actually suffered the killing of the animal portrayed in the picture. The pictorial representation was nothing but the anticipation of the desired effect; the real event had inevitably to follow the magical sample action—or rather, to be already contained within it, as both were separated from each other merely by the supposedly unreal medium of space and time.

  <b>The solution is A</b>: underwent phases similar to those of recent art history.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to make an inference about what some people think about the topic based on the way the author positions those people relative to the author’s own position.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: underwent phases similar to those of recent art history.
<br>
Correct. "The most remarkable thing about prehistoric naturalism is…that it already reveals all the typical phases of development through which art has passed in modern times and is <i>not</i>…the merely instinctive, static phenomenon that scholars…declare it to be" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: was produced by primitive hunters.
<br>
Incorrect. The author claims this as an uncontested fact: "We know that [prehistoric naturalism] was the art of primitive hunters…" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: satisfied an instinctive need for playful self-expression.
<br>
Incorrect. The author raises the question of purpose but does not convey any disagreement about whether prehistoric naturalism satisfied an instinctive need for playful self-expression.
<br><br>
Option D: predated a geometric style of representation.
<br>
Incorrect. The author treats the opening claim that prehistoric naturalism is older than the geometric style ("The most remarkable thing about prehistoric naturalism is <i>not</i> that <i>it is older than the geometric style</i>…") as an uncontested fact.

  <summary>Question 88</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: it is based on reasoning and knowledge.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which tests your understanding of a claim that is made explicitly in the passage and that uses language very close to that used in the correct option.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: it is direct and unsophisticated.
<br>
Incorrect. "Children's drawings…give a theoretically synthetic…picture of the object" (paragraph 2) suggests otherwise.
<br><br>

<br>
Incorrect. "Children's drawings are…not sensory...They show what the child know[s], not what they actually see…" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option C: it is based on reasoning and knowledge.
<br>
Correct. "Children's drawings are rationalistic…They show what the child… know[s]…" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option D: it is truthful and objective.
<br>
Incorrect. "Children's drawings…show what the child…know[s]…" suggests subjectivity rather than objectivity.

  <summary>Question 89</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: more aware of their visual environment.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify a comparison made in the passage (here, between paleolithic and modern artists) and to move from the passage information to select a paraphrase of that information as the answer.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: less able to depict natural forms with accuracy.
<br>
  Incorrect. The author suggests painters of the Paleolithic Age are <i>more</i> able to depict natural forms with accuracy: "The peculiar thing about the naturalistic drawings of the Old Stone Age is…that they give the visual impression in such a direct, unmixed form, free from all intellectual trimmings or restrictions…" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: less likely to notice subtle variations in color.
<br>
  Incorrect. The author suggests they are <i>more</i> likely to notice subtle variations in color: "The painters of the Paleolithic Age were still able to see delicate shades with the naked eye that modern people are able to discover only with the help of complicated scientific instruments" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option C: more likely to create abstract interpretations of scenes.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says artists of the Paleolithic Age "give the visual impression in such a direct…form" (paragraph 3) suggests they are <i>less</i> likely to create abstract interpretations.
<br><br>
Option D: more aware of their visual environment.
<br>
Correct. Paragraph 3 compares modern people and artists of the Paleolithic Age: “The peculiar thing about the naturalistic drawings of the Old Stone Age is, on the other hand, that they give the visual impression in such a direct, unmixed form, free from all intellectual trimmings or restrictions. The painters of the Paleolithic Age were still able to see delicate shades with the naked eye that modern people are able to discover only with the help of complicated scientific instruments.” It is true that the comparison talks about modern “people” rather than modern artists, per se, but modern artists are modern people and the passage clearly implies that artists of the Paleolithic Age have an acute awareness of their visual environment that is not available to modern people.

  <summary>Question 90</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: a technique without mystery.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to look at the premises of the author’s argument and to find a potential tension or contradiction within that argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: both representation and the thing represented.
<br>
Incorrect. In the author’s discussion of the purpose of prehistoric art, the author writes that “The paleolithic hunter and painter felt in possession of the thing itself in the picture, felt power over the object and the portrayal of the object…" (final paragraph) which is in accord with this option.
<br><br>
Option B: a technique without mystery.
<br>
Correct. On the one hand, the author tells us about prehistoric art that: “there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served any other purpose than a means to the procuring of food” (paragraph 5), and goes on to explain that the art had a “pragmatic function” and “was a technique without mystery” (paragraph 5). On the other hand, the author describes the beliefs of the prehistoric artists: “The paleolithic hunter and painter felt in possession of the thing itself in the picture, felt power over the object in the portrayal of the object. The hunter believed the real animal actually suffered the killing of the animal portrayed in the picture. The pictorial representation was nothing but the anticipation of the desired effect; the real event had inevitably to follow the magical sample action” (final paragraph). For a “modern,” reader, the idea that the picture itself accomplishes the killing of the animal is difficult to reconcile with the claim that the artistic technique is “without mystery”; these beliefs about the picture seem impossible to hold without a belief in mystery.
<br><br>
Option C: the art of primitive people who had to capture their food.
<br>
Incorrect. The author writes: "The pictures…were the 'trap' into which the game had to go … The hunter believed the real animal actually suffered the killing of the animal portrayed in the picture …" (final paragraph). These statements are consistent with this option.
<br><br>
Option D: a weapon in the struggle for livelihood.
<br>
Incorrect. "The pictures … were the 'trap' into which the game had to go … " (final paragraph) suggests an idea that is consistent with this option.

  <summary>Question 91</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: the artist gained control over the object portrayed.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it tests your understanding of a passage statement that uses language fairly close to the language in the answer; you do need to recognize that the author is describing someone’s beliefs, rather than endorsing the truths of these beliefs himself or herself.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: reality was subjective, and each artist's vision was unique.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not describe paleolithic artists as believing in subjective reality, or a “unique” creative vision for each artist. The latter point would likely be contradicted by the passage claim that paleolithic art was devoted to a “pragmatic” function.
<br><br>
Option B: the artist acquired the qualities of the object portrayed.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option C: the skill of the artist should impress the viewer.
<br>
Incorrect. The author writes that there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served any other purpose than a means to the procuring of food” (paragraph 5); the author does not suggest, then, that the artist was preoccupied with “impressing the viewer.”
<br><br>
Option D: the artist gained control over the object portrayed.
<br>
Correct. "The paleolithic hunter and painter felt <i>in possession of</i> the thing itself in the picture, <i>felt power over the object</i> in the portrayal of the object" (final paragraph). This quotation clearly suggests that the paleolithic artists believed they gained control over the object portrayed.

<details>
  <summary>Question 92</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: They disprove it by showing that some artists could not have had the motive attributed to them.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a hypothetical scenario not discussed in the passage and asks you how this scenario would affect passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: They support it by showing that paleolithic artists painted a variety of things that were important to hunters.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not the author's theory: "…there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served <i>any other purpose than</i> a means to the procuring of food" (paragraph 5). If the hunters portrayed things <i>other than</i> food they would eat, then surely the portrayals would include only the means by which they would acquire food (not the mountains, lakes, and rivers near or in which they would acquire it).
<br><br>
Option B: They weaken it by showing that the painters probably believed that these objects had spiritual powers.
<br>
Incorrect. This does not weaken the author's theory as it does not say or imply the contrary.
<br><br>
Option C: They disprove it by showing that some artists could not have had the motive attributed to them.
<br>
Correct. The author writes "…there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served <i>any other purpose</i> than a means to the procuring of food" (paragraph 5), so if the hunters portrayed things <i>other than</i> food (or perhaps the means by which they would acquire food), such as mountains, lakes, and rivers, that would indeed disprove the theory.
<br><br>
Option D: They do not affect it, because it applies only to pictures of animals.
<br>
Incorrect. The theory is not limited to pictures of animals; the theory claims that paleolithic painters limited themselves to pictures of animals.

  <summary>Question 93</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: instability, which focused all actions on survival.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to use information stated in the passage to make an inference about a point that follows from the author’s stated claim.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: leisure time, which allowed cultural activities to be pursued.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is contradicted by the statement: "In this age of purely practical life, everything obviously still turned around the bare earning of a livelihood, and there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served any other purpose than a means to the procuring of food" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option B: instability, which focused all actions on survival.
<br>
Correct. This option is supported by the statement: "In this age of purely practical life, everything obviously still turned around the bare earning of a livelihood, and there is nothing to justify us in assuming that art served any other purpose than a means to the procuring of food" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: hunting skills, which produced the expectation that equal skill would be shown in painting the animals that were hunted.
<br>
Incorrect. This option—specifically the part about the expectation—is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: social organization, which produced the specialization needed for the creation of art.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage and is, in fact, contradicted by the point that primitive hunters live in "unstable, almost entirely unorganized social patterns" (paragraph 4).
