# Passage 12
Can Achilles really be the first hero of literature? He seems a fool, an infantile narcissist. The first word of _The Iliad_ is _menin_—in old Greek, “rage” or “wrath”—the kind of rage that has an element of divine fury in it and destroys armies and breaks cities. But to us, Achilles’ anger seems less divine than egotistical. His war booty has been stolen by another man. Is not the immense size of his anger almost absurdly out of proportion to its cause?

He is very young, a compound of muscle and beauty with so powerful a sense of his own precedence that he is willing to let the war go badly when his honor is sullied. The Trojans kill many Greeks and come close to burning the Greek ships and cutting off their retreat. Hoping to stem the tide, Achilles’ beloved friend Patroclus enters the battle wearing Achilles’ armor and, as a substitute for Achilles, is slain.

Enraged, inconsolable, Achilles prepares at last to enter the battle. The sky darkens, the underworld nearly cracks open. Huge forces, unstoppable, move into place. Achilles begins to fight, expelling his anguish in a rampage.

The Western reader comes from a society that is nominally ethical. The U.S. legal and administrative system, presidential utterances, popular culture (in which TV police officers rarely fail to care for the victims of crime) are swathed in concern. Since many U.S. citizens believe their society is actually indifferent to hardship, it is no surprise that irony and cynicism barnacle their attitudes toward public life. By contrast, the Greek view was savage, but it was offered without hypocrisy. Accepting death in battle as inevitable, the Greek and Trojan aristocrats of _The Iliad_ experience the world not as pleasant or unpleasant, or as good and evil, but as glorious or shameful—a noble rather than an ethical conception of life.

How can a man who stays out of the action through many days (and many thousands of lines), angrily keeping to his tent as friends and enemies die, remain the hero of an epic? The answer suggests why _The Iliad_, for all its frightening strangeness, will not easily yield its place or its predominance at the beginning of our literary tradition.

Achilles’ rage has the remarkable effect of stunning this haughty young man into a new conception of war. Suddenly, he is groping toward an idea of honor that does not depend on the bartering of women and goods or on the opinions men have of one another’s prowess. “We are all held in a single honor. . . . A man dies still if he has done nothing, as one who has done much.” For the greatest warrior in the world, that is a devastating admission. From the Western point of view, Achilles has jumped forward to a private, or even spiritual, sense of worth: Honor is a matter between one and Zeus or between one and oneself, and in the end, no one can be compensated for the death of another; the worth of life is immeasurable. Achilles has come close to breaking with the honor/shame code of Homer’s warrior society.

Rage such as Achilles’, once awakened, cannot be silenced. The questions he asks about war and death remain unanswered in the poem, because they cannot be answered. _The Iliad_, for all its vaunting glory, remains in tension with itself, questioning, and even subverting, its own ethos, and it leaves one profoundly uneasy. Achilles knows he will attain immortal renown as a hero, yet he is the only one who takes the measure of death.

  <summary>Question 67</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: the divine and the all-too-human.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that asks you to make a comparison based on descriptions that are explicitly in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the divine and the all-too-human.
<br>
Correct. " …in old Greek, 'rage' or 'wrath'—[is] the kind of rage that has an element of divine fury in it…. But to us, Achilles' anger seems less divine than egotistical" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: classical and modern conceptions of human nature.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: restraint and excess.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author does refer to "the immense size of [Achilles'] anger" (first paragraph), this reference to excess is made in order to distinguish between restraint and excess with respect to rage and anger. There is no indication that the Greek concept of rage is one of restraint.
<br><br>
Option D: the quest for glory and the quest for booty.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does mention Achilles' war booty (first paragraph), but to emphasize that his anger is egotistical, not to distinguish between the quest for glory and the quest for booty as the distinction between Greek rage and Achilles’s anger.

  <summary>Question 68</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: It considers war in moral terms; the Greeks considered war in terms of glory.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which begins with a statement that is not discussed in the passage and asks how this statement would impact or compare to the points discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It sees war as political; the Greeks saw war as ethical.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is contrary to the passage: "The Western reader comes from a society that is nominally ethical.…By contrast, the Greek view was savage" (paragraph 4)
<br><br>
Option B: It considers war in moral terms; the Greeks considered war in terms of glory.
<br>
Correct. Assuming that the prevention of a bigger war is considered a moral preference, the option does consider war in moral terms. By contrast, the passage tells us that the Greeks viewed war in terms of glory: “Accepting death in battle as inevitable, the Greek and Trojan aristocrats of The Iliad experience the world not as pleasant or unpleasant, or as good and evil, but as glorious or shameful—a noble rather than an ethical conception of life” (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: It puts war in a heroic context that is similar to Greek ideas.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage doesn't indicate that the Greek view of war involves heroism, but rather focuses on glory or shame (paragraph 4, for instance).
<br><br>
Option D: It affirms the Greek belief about the worth of human life.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage identifies "the worth of life [as] immeasurable" (paragraph 6) as part of the new conception of war that Achilles gains; this is not presented in the passage as the Greek view.

  <summary>Question 69</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: questioned the concept of honor in war.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to consider the purpose of an author’s use of evidence; it asks you to use context and your understanding of the author’s intentions in the passage to evaluate the function of a particular piece of evidence.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: questioned the concept of honor in war.
<br>
Correct. The author describes the recognition within this quotation as a “devastating admission for the greatest warrior in the world” (paragraph 6). The passage goes on to explore the consequences of Achilles’s recognition: “From the Western point of view, Achilles has jumped forward to a private…sense of worth: Honor is a matter between one and Zeus or between one and oneself, and in the end, no one can be compensated for the death of another. Achilles has come close to breaking with the honor/shame code of Homer’s warrior society” (paragraph 6). The final sentence, in particular, supports this option as correct.
<br><br>
Option B: was angered by the death of Patroclus.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no connection made by the author between the mentioned quotation and Achilles' anger due to the death of Patroclus.
<br><br>
Option C: thought that all people should have equal rights.
<br>
Incorrect. This option requires you to make assumptions that are not supported by the passage: “The author does say that “Suddenly, [Achilles] is groping toward an idea of honor that does not depend on the bartering of women and goods or on the opinions men have of one another’s prowess” (paragraph 6). This suggests that Achilles is moving toward a potentially less inequitable vision of honor, but this does not support the claim that Achilles believes in “equal rights” for “all people.”
<br><br>
Option D: had deep faith in his gods.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage may or may not suggest that Achilles had deep faith in his gods—"Honor is a matter between one and Zeus <i>or between one and oneself</i>" (paragraph 6); in any case, the mentioned quotation is not presented to support Achilles’ faith.

  <summary>Question 70</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: To help Westerners to understand the poem in the context of Greek culture

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, as it asks you to assess the function or effect of a passage discussion; to answer the question, you need to be able to understand how this discussion fits into the author’s argument..
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: To suggest that Western culture is less moral than was Greek culture
<br>
Incorrect. The passage suggests the opposite: "The Western reader comes from a society that is nominally ethical.…By contrast, the Greek view was savage" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option B: To emphasize the similarities between the culture of the West and that of Greece
<br>
Incorrect. The passage emphasizes a difference between Western culture and the Greek view: "The Western reader comes from a society that is nominally ethical.…By contrast, the Greek view was savage" (paragraph 4). This difference is emphasized again later in the passage: “from a Western point of view…” (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option C: To help Westerners to understand the poem in the context of Greek culture
<br>
  Correct. Note that the author opens the paragraph with "<i>The Western reader</i>…" (paragraph 4) and then goes on to explain that the Western context is an ethical one, whereas "the Greek and Trojan aristocrats of <i>The Iliad</i> experience the world not as…good and evil, but as glorious or shameful—a noble rather than an ethical conception of life" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
  Option D: To explain the literary importance of <i>The Iliad</i> in all cultures
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for "in all cultures.”

  <summary>Question 71</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: accept public accolades for killing enemy soldiers.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to use a passage argument to make a prediction about a situation not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: struggle against death when diagnosed with a fatal disease.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no indication in the passage that Achilles accepts death: "The questions he asks about…death remain unanswered…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: bring children into the world.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option. In fact, if one believes "the worth of life is immeasurable" (paragraph 6), as Achilles comes to see it, then one might potentially be inclined to bring children into the world.
<br><br>
Option C: protest against war.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says that "The questions he asks about war…remain unanswered" (final paragraph), so we cannot choose this option with any certainty.
<br><br>
Option D: accept public accolades for killing enemy soldiers.
<br>
Correct. The passage suggests that Achilles has begun to believe that "no one can be compensated for the death of another" (paragraph 6) and that even the lives of enemy soldiers have worth—"the worth of life is immeasurable" (final paragraph), which certainly suggests that he would <i>not</i> be inclined to accept public accolades for killing enemy soldiers.
