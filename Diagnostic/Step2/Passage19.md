# Passage 19
The frontier of Frederick J. Turner was a process, not a place. When "civilization" had conquered "savagery" at any one location, the process — and the historian’s attention — moved on. In rethinking its history, we gain the freedom to think of the West as many complicated environments with inhabitants who considered their homeland to be at the center, not the edge, of the known world.

Even in choosing to stress place more than process, however, we cannot fix the region exactly. The West means the present-day states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and the states between them and the Pacific Ocean, but it can include Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. This vastness certainly makes for a complicated package, but the West as a place has a compensatory, down-to-earth clarity that the migratory, abstract frontier could never have.

The reorganized history of the West concerns a land undergoing conquest and never fully escaping its consequences. In this respect, it shares features with the histories of other parts of the nation and the world. According to the Turner thesis, Western history stood alone. An exciting counter-trend in modern scholarship favors comparative history; the history of Western America becomes a chapter in the global story of European expansion. Studies in "comparative conquests" promise to help to reknit the fragmented history of the globe, and Western history can be a prime contributor to that endeavor. De-emphasize the frontier and its supposed end, conceive of the American West as a place and not a process, and its history has a new look.

First, the area was an important meeting ground, the point at which Native America, Latin America, Anglo-America, Afro-America, and Asia intersected. In race relations, the West could make the end-of-the-nineteenth-century Northeastern urban confrontation between recent European immigrants and the descendants of earlier ones look like a family reunion. Similarly, in the diversity of its languages, religions, and cultures, it surpassed the South.

Second, the effects of conquest tied these diverse groups into the same story. Happily or not, minorities and majorities occupied a common ground. Conquest basically involved the definition and allocation of ownership (personal, tribal, corporate, state, federal, and international) and the transformation of land from scenery into property. The process had two stages: the initial drawing of lines on a map (usually called the frontier stage) and the giving of meaning and power to those boundaries, a process that is still under way.

Race relations tend to reflect the distribution of property, the application of labor and capital to make the property productive, and the allocation of profit. Western history has been an ongoing competition for legitimacy, for the right to proclaim oneself and sometimes one’s group the legitimate beneficiary of Western resources. The pervasive association of ethnic diversity with property allocation unifies Western history.

A struggle for property and profit is typically accompanied by a contest for cultural dominance. Conquest often involves conflicts over language, culture, and religion. In the West, efforts to establish the legitimacy of ownership have overlapped efforts to establish the legitimacy of a way of life and point of view. In a variety of matters, but especially in unresolved questions of Indian assimilation and in disputes over bilingualism and immigration in the still semi-Hispanic Southwest, cultural dominance remains a major issue. Reconceived as an ongoing struggle, the fragmented and discontinuous past becomes a comprehensible whole.

  <summary>Question 105</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: revisionist.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to assess or evaluate the author’s opinion of Turner’s view of Western history, by integrating evidence or cues to the author’s view from different parts of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: enthusiastic.
<br>
Incorrect. The author presents Turner’s version of Western history as an older, more standard position and is “enthusiastic” about the newer scholarship that critiques the Turner approach: “According to the Turner thesis, Western history stood alone. An exciting counter-trend in modern scholarship favors comparative history; the history of Western America becomes a chapter in the global story of European expansion” (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: noncommittal.
<br>
Incorrect. The author commits to the revision of history—and thus, a revision of Turner--at several points in the passage. For instance, the author says: "history has a new look" (paragraph 3); "First, …" — paragraph 4); "Second, …"—paragraph 5). The author, then, takes a position on the value of Turner’s approach and does not remain neutral.
<br><br>
Option C: revisionist.
<br>
Correct. The opening paragraph describes the Turner thesis of Western history and then asserts: “in rethinking its history, we gain the freedom to think of the West as many complicated environments….” Paragraph 3 argues for a "reorganized history of the West." The author, then, is <i>revising</i> the Turner thesis, according to which "Western history stood alone. An exciting counter-trend…favors comparative history" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option D: frustrated.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no evidence in the passage for the author feeling or sounding “frustrated” by Turner’s approach; the author takes a reasonable and thoughtful tone throughout the passage.

<details>
  <summary>Question 106</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: an aspect of a continuing contest for economic dominance.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it introduces a novel scenario and asks you to apply the arguments in the passage to that scenario.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the result of an inequitable distribution of property.
<br>
Incorrect. The author explains in the final paragraph that conflicts over language are involved with struggles for property, not that the latter <i>cause</i> the former.
<br><br>
Option B: an aspect of a continuing contest for economic dominance.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "A struggle for property…is typically accompanied by a contest for cultural dominance. Conquest often involves conflicts over language…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: evidence that the concept of the West is too vague.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option D: characteristic of a stage of development in frontier areas.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not say that contests for cultural dominance are a <i>stage of development</i>, but rather that they are ongoing (paragraph 6) and points to at least one instance in which disputes over bilingualism are still <i>unresolved</i> (final paragraph) in an area that is <i>not</i> "frontier."

  <summary>Question 107</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: the competition between groups ended when settlement extended to the Pacific.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify, from rhetorical choices and context, a point that is implicit, but not directly stated, in the author’s argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the culture of the Southwest reflects contributions from many ethnic groups.
<br>
Incorrect. The author claims that the West has not escaped the consequences of conquest (paragraph 3) and provides as the first <i>support</i> for this thesis, the existing cultural diversity in the West. The author, then, does not dispute this point.
<br><br>
Option B: the increasing population of Western communities is a sign of prosperity.
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s point about the persistence of the consequences of conquest does not dispute anything about the indices of prosperity in the West.
<br><br>
Option C: the competition between groups ended when settlement extended to the Pacific.
<br>
Correct. In paragraph 3, the author writes: “The reorganized history of the West concerns a land undergoing conquest and never fully escaping its consequences.” The author writes later in the passage that “Western history has been an ongoing competition for legitimacy, for the right to proclaim oneself and sometimes one’s group the legitimate beneficiary of Western resources” (paragraph 6). The latter statement clearly implies that competition among groups for resources and other forms of legitimacy hardly ended when “settlement reached the Pacific,” but continues.
<br><br>
Option D: the ownership of land in Western states is a legitimate right.
<br>
Incorrect. The author discusses the question of “legitimacy” in the passage as an ongoing one. For example: “In the West, efforts to establish the legitimacy of ownership have overlapped efforts to establish the legitimacy of a way of life and point of view” (paragraph 6). The author does not at any point dispute, implicitly or explicitly, that land ownership may be a legitimate right.

<details>
  <summary>Question 108</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: a struggle for ascendancy among competing cultural groups.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it tests your understanding of a first-level claim in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the loss of ethnic identity among the descendants of the conquered people.
<br>
  Incorrect. The author describes the struggle as one for cultural <i>dominance</i> (final paragraph), which in no way means that there is any kind of inevitable loss of “ethnic identity” that accompanies or results from conquest, but that ethnic identity can become a contested matter.
<br><br>
Option B: degradation of the environment through the exploitation of its resources.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported in the passage; the author mentions only "the transformation of land from scenery into property" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: the concentration of influence in a small group of property owners.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported in the passage; the author says "Conquest basically involved the definition and allocation of ownership" (paragraph 5), but subsequent reference is to variation in the size of group ownership in many dimensions, from personal to international.
<br><br>
Option D: a struggle for ascendancy among competing cultural groups.
<br>
Correct. The author elaborates on the struggle for property and profit that defines conquest (paragraph 5) as accompanied by "a contest for <i>cultural dominance</i>" (final paragraph), which would indeed suggest a struggle for <i>ascendancy</i> among competing <i>cultural groups</i>.

<details>
  <summary>Question 109</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: world events on specific regions.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to examine the meaning of a term that the author uses, in the context of its use in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: ethnic groups on local cultures.
<br>
Incorrect. The influence of ethnic groups on local cultures is not part of the author’s discussion of a “reorganized” history, as the author presents the concept.
<br><br>
Option B: world events on specific regions.
<br>
  Correct. According to the “reorganized” history, the author maintains, the <i>history</i> of Western America becomes a chapter in the global story of European expansion,", rather than a unique story that “stood alone” (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option C: geographic features on human activities.
<br>
Incorrect. The reorganization, as the author presents the concept, does not refer to physical geography, but to a model for understanding history, as discussed in paragraph 3.
<br><br>
Option D: democratic ideals on ignorant resistance.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no discussion of the “triumph” of democracy over “resistance,” in the passage, and the author certainly does not characterize resistance in this fashion.

  <summary>Question 110</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Continuing migration into the region will cause a redistribution of property.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to use passage content to make a prediction about a scenario that is outside the context of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Continuing migration into the region will cause a redistribution of property.
<br>
Correct. This option is supported by much of paragraph 6: “Western history has been an ongoing competition for legitimacy, for the right to proclaim oneself and sometimes one’s group the legitimate beneficiary of Western resources. The pervasive association of ethnic diversity with property allocation unifies Western history.”
<br><br>
Option B: Full settlement of the continental U.S. will remove the reason for territorial competition.
<br>
  Incorrect. The author’s claim that: "Reconceived as an <i>ongoing struggle</i>, the fragmented and discontinuous past becomes a comprehensible whole" (final paragraph) suggests that even with full settlement, struggle for property will continue.
<br><br>
Option C: Subdivisions will fragment the land holdings indicated by lines on nineteenth-century maps.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not suggest that the lines drawn on nineteenth century maps have remained static and unchanging since they were drawn, as this option would have it: “Conquest basically involved the definition and allocation of ownership (personal, tribal, corporate, state, federal, and international) and the transformation of land from scenery into property. The process had two stages: the initial drawing of lines on a map (usually called the frontier stage) and the giving of meaning and power to those boundaries, <i>a process that is still under way</i>” (paragraph 5, emphasis added).
<br><br>
Option D: The common concerns of Westerners will cause their ethnicity to lose its relevance.
<br>
Incorrect. The final paragraph of the passage explicitly challenges this: "cultural dominance remains a major issue."
