# Passage 2
The scientist trying to understand human diversity has to deal with the problem of short-term adaptation (or acclimatization) and long-term adaptations related to survival in a particular environment. We know that individuals possess enough plasticity to adapt to new conditions in the short run-e.g., tanning in high-light conditions. However, this plasticity is very different from the adaptive capacity of individuals living in an environment over a long period of time.

In humans, as well as among other animals, climatic adaptations involve at least four different mechanisms: genetic changes, growth changes, physiological changes, and behavioral changes. Genetic changes are the slowest of the group, while behavioral changes are normally the most rapid. Genetic changes are intergenerational changes which occur between successive generations of a population. Growth changes refer to ontogenetic changes-i.e., relatively irreversible changes occurring within an individual's lifetime. Physiological changes are, for the most part, reversible. An example of this would be the menstrual disorders experienced by females who move from low to high altitudes and back to low altitudes.

Our behavioral response takes on a greater importance than is the case with any other animal. Because of our culturally patterned ways of dealing with environmental stresses, much of behavior, although capable of rapid alteration, usually manifests itself in quite stable patterns that are nongenetically generationally transmitted. This has proven to be a highly efficient means of responding to environmental stress, permitting Homo sapiens to explore many possibilities for moving into new environments. For this reason, we inhabit a diverse array of environments. Although cultural adaptations have sometimes replaced genetic responses, the possibility of cultural adaptations to environmental stress has not totally excluded genetic adaptations.

The human body comes in various shapes and sizes. Some variation is undoubtedly due to nutrition, but some is a response to long-standing adaptations to certain habitats. Two rules, _Bergmann's rule_ (formulated in 1847) and _Allen's rule_ (formulated in 1877), are often used to explain the diversity in body size and shape in animals. The climatic factor in the case of both rules is cold or heat. Allen's rule, which deals with shape changes to achieve an optimal volume-to-surface ratio, states that extremities and appendages (ears, limbs, tail, fingers, and toes) tend to be shorter in colder climates. Because they expose less body surface and are closer to the body's core temperature, shorter extremities conserve heat. Longer extremities expose greater body surface and offer additional surface for dissipating heat in warm climates. Bergmann's rule, dealing with volume, states that body size tends to be greater (heavier) in cold than in warm climates. Furthermore, Bergmann's rule maintains that in warmer climates, the individual is taller. In colder climates, the individual is stockier and shorter. Bergmann's rule describes the relationship between body volume and surface area. A low surface area to high body volume is efficient in heat retention, a high surface area and low body volume proportion is efficient in heat dissipation.

These rules were relatively unknown as explanatory vehicles of human diversity until 1950. Even now no one argues that these rules can be strictly applied to animal populations in all cases; however, they are possible explanatory models for various adaptive traits.

  <summary>Question 8</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: genetic changes.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to use the definitions of terms explicitly described in the passage and apply these to other instances in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: behavioral changes.
<br>
Incorrect. The adaptations covered by Allen's and Bergmann's rules apply to body shape and size, not behavior.
<br><br>
Option B: physiological changes.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says that "Physiological changes are, for the most part, reversible" (paragraph 2), and the changes explained by the two rules are not (they concern body shape and size).
<br><br>
Option C: growth changes.
<br>
  Incorrect. Growth changes refer to "changes occurring within <i>an individual</i>'s lifetime" (paragraph 2), whereas the changes covered by the two rules concern "animal populations" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: genetic changes.
<br>
Correct. The author distinguishes genetic changes from the other three kinds of changes by saying they are the slowest (paragraph 2) and they are "intergenerational changes which occur between successive generations <i>of a population</i>" (paragraph 2). The two rules discuss "diversity in body size and shape in animals" (paragraph 4)—that is, within a <i>population</i>.

  <summary>Question 9</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: generationally transmitted behavior patterns.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify a basic component of the text—a point made explicitly by the author.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: intergenerational genetic changes.
<br>
Incorrect. The explanation provided in paragraph 3 for our ability to inhabit a diverse array of environments refers to "<i>non</i>genetically" transmitted behaviors.
<br><br>
Option B: reversible physiological changes.
<br>
Incorrect. The explanation provided in paragraph 3 for our ability to inhabit a diverse array of environments refers to behavior, not physiology.
<br><br>
Option C: ontogenetic growth changes.
<br>
Incorrect. The explanation provided in paragraph 3 for our ability to inhabit a diverse array of environments refers to behavior, not growth changes.
<br><br>
Option D: generationally transmitted behavior patterns.
<br>
Correct. The passage says " … much of behavior … manifests itself in quite stable patterns that are nongenetically <i>generationally transmitted</i>. This has proven to be a highly efficient means of responding to environmental stress, permitting <i>Homo sapiens</i> to explore many possibilities for moving into new environments. <i>For this reason, we inhabit a diverse array of environments</i>" (paragraph 3). This option, then, is essentially a paraphrase of the passage.

  <summary>Question 10</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Allen's rule does not hold true uniformly.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a scenario not discussed in the passage and asks you to consider how that scenario would affect passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Allen's rule does not hold true uniformly.
<br>
Correct. Allen's rule "states that extremities … tend to be shorter in colder climates" and longer in warmer climates (paragraph 4); because the scenario in the question describes a warm-climate population with long upper extremities but short lower extremities, the rule must not hold true uniformly, making this option correct.
<br><br>
Option B: Bergmann's rule is correct.
<br>
Incorrect. Bergmann's rule is about body size, or “volume,” and its relation to climate. It is not about shape changes.
<br><br>
Option C: Allen's rule is incorrect.
<br>
Incorrect. As explained in paragraph 4, Allen's rule says that in warm climates, extremities would be longer (to offer additional surface for dissipating heat); because this is the case described for at least the upper extremities, the rule must be at least partly correct.
<br><br>
Option D: Bergmann's rule requires modification.
<br>
Incorrect. Bergmann's rule is about volume; any information about extremity length is simply not covered by the rule and so does not require modification of the rule.

  <summary>Question 11</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: cannot be applied in all cases.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to locate information explicitly stated in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: were formulated in the nineteenth century.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the rules were formulated in the nineteenth century, (the dates are given in paragraph 4), there is no reason to consider this a “drawback” of the rules.
<br><br>
Option B: cannot be applied in all cases.
<br>
Correct. The author explicitly states: "no one argues that these rules can be strictly applied to animal populations <i>in all cases</i>" (final paragraph), making this option correct.
<br><br>
Option C: were little known before 1950.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the rules were “relatively unknown as explanatory vehicles of human diversity before 1950 (final paragraph), there is no reason to consider this a drawback of the rules themselves.
<br><br>
Option D: have little explanatory power.
<br>
Incorrect. The author explicitly calls the rules “possible explanatory models for various adaptive traits” in the concluding sentence of the passage.

  <summary>Question 12</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: a physiological response.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents information that is not included in the passage and asks you to apply passage information to interpret it.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a genetic response.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage describes genetic changes as "intergenerational" (paragraph 2), which does not describe perspiration due to environmental stress.
<br><br>
Option B: a growth response.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage presents growth changes as "relatively irreversible" (paragraph 2) and as "occurring within an individual's lifetime" (paragraph 2), which does not describe perspiration due to environmental stress.
<br><br>
Option C: a physiological response.
<br>
Correct. The author discusses physiological responses as one kind of “climatic adaptation” (paragraph 2). The author writes, “Physiological changes are, for the most part, reversible. An example of this would be the menstrual disorders experienced by females who move from low to high altitudes and back to low altitudes” (paragraph 2). Perspiration due to “environmental stress” would be an example of such a reversible physical response.
<br><br>
Option D: a behavioral response.
<br>
Incorrect. Behavior is presented in the passage as "culturally patterned ways of dealing with environmental stresses" (paragraph 3) and perspiring is physiological, not cultural.
