# Passage 9
Should doctors ever lie to benefit their patients—to speed recovery or to conceal the approach of death? In medicine as in law, government, and other lines of work, the requirements of honesty often seem dwarfed by greater needs: the need to shelter from brutal news or to uphold a promise of secrecy; to expose corruption or to promote the public interest.

What should doctors say, for example, to a 46-year-old man coming in for a routine physical checkup just before going on vacation with his family who, though he feels in perfect health, is found to have a form of cancer that will cause him to die within six months? Is it best to tell him the truth? If he asks, should the doctors deny that he is ill, or minimize the gravity of the prognosis? Should they at least conceal the truth until after the family vacation? Doctors confront such choices often and urgently. At times, they see important reasons to lie for the patient’s own sake; in their eyes, such lies differ sharply from self-serving ones.

Studies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate faster, perhaps even commit suicide. As one physician wrote: “Ours is a profession which traditionally has been guided by a precept that transcends the virtue of uttering the truth for truth’s sake, and that is ‘as far as possible, do no harm.’” Armed with such a precept, a number of doctors may slip into deceptive practices that they assume will “do no harm” and may well help their patients. They may prescribe innumerable placebos, sound more encouraging than the facts warrant, and distort grave news, especially to the incurably ill and the dying.

But the illusory nature of the benefits such deception is meant to bestow is now coming to be documented. Studies show that an overwhelming majority of patients do want to be told the truth, even about grave illness. We are also learning that truthful information, humanely conveyed, helps patients cope with illness: helps them tolerate pain better, need less medication, and even recover faster after surgery.

Not only do lies not provide the “help” hoped for by advocates of benevolent deception; they invade the autonomy of patients and render them unable to make informed choices concerning their own health, including the choice of whether to be a patient in the first place. We are becoming increasingly aware of all that can befall patients in the course of their illness when information is denied or distorted. Dying patients especially—who are easiest to mislead and most often kept in the dark—can then not make decisions about the end of life: about whether or not to enter a hospital, or to have surgery; about where and with whom to spend their remaining time; about how to bring their affairs to a close and take leave.

Lies also do harm to those who tell them: harm to their integrity and, in the long run, to their credibility. Lies hurt their colleagues as well. The suspicion of deceit undercuts the work of the many doctors who are scrupulously honest with their patients; it contributes to the spiral of litigation and of “defensive medicine,” and thus it injures, in turn, the entire medical profession.

  <summary>Question 48</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: disapproval and comprehension.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to assess the author’s attitude towards her topic by integrating explicit and implicit rhetorical statements and cues across the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: indignation and contempt.
<br>
Incorrect. Both words in this option are too strong and too exclusively negative to accurately describe the author's attitude toward such physicians.
<br><br>
Option B: disapproval and comprehension.
<br>
Correct. The author does express disapproval: "Not only do lies not provide the 'help' hoped for by advocates of benevolent deception; they invade the autonomy of patients…" (paragraph 5). The author again expresses disapproval in the final paragraph. However, the author also expresses understanding of the motives of doctors who do deceive their patients, in paragraph 3. For instance, “Studies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate faster, perhaps even commit suicide” (paragraph 3). This and the rest of the paragraph makes clear that the author does not simply condemn doctors who fail to tell their patients the truth.
<br><br>
Option C: perplexity and tolerance.
<br>
Incorrect. The third paragraph challenges "perplexity," because the author describes an understanding of the reasons that some doctors believe they are helping their patients by ‘protecting’ them from the truth of their conditions. Paragraphs 4 and the final paragraph challenge "tolerance,” however, as the author takes a strong position against the deceptive approach.
<br><br>
Option D: regret and justification.
<br>
Incorrect. Paragraphs 4 through the end of the passage challenge the behavior of physicians who deceive patients; the author offers no justification for their failure to inform patients of the truth, only some understanding of why they do this (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 49</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: Patients may deteriorate if they have no reason to hope.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it requires you to determine from passage context which statements the author does and does NOT endorse.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Physicians may knowingly prescribe medically unjustified treatments.
<br>
Incorrect. This claim is made in the passage: "They may prescribe innumerable placebos" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: Knowledge about their condition can help patients in many ways.
<br>
Incorrect. This claim is made in the passage: "We are also learning that truthful information…helps patients cope with illness…" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: Patients may deteriorate if they have no reason to hope.
<br>
  Correct. This claim is <i>not</i> made in the passage. The author says that studies show that doctors may believe this to be true (paragraph 3), but there is no indication that the author agrees.
<br><br>
Option D: Doctors are often wrong about patients’ wishes.
<br>
  Incorrect. This claim is made in the passage: "…an overwhelming majority of patients <i>do</i> want to be told the truth…" (paragraph 4), in contrast to, "…most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill do <i>not</i> want to know the truth about their condition…" (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 50</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Those who deny that their condition is serious usually have milder symptoms.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider situations that are not discussed in the passage, in order to assess how these situations would affect—and in this case, <i>weaken</i>--the author’s argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Those who deny that their condition is serious usually have milder symptoms.
<br>
Correct. This option suggests that when patients don’t know or internalize the truth about their condition, it can benefit their health. It therefore challenges the author’s claim: "But the illusory nature of the benefits such deception is meant to bestow is now coming to be documented" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option B: Those who are denied the truth seldom realize that they have been deceived.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant to the author's position; the author does not argue otherwise.
<br><br>
Option C: Those who guess the truth usually encourage false hopes in their families.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant to the author's position; the author does not argue otherwise.
<br><br>
Option D: Those who are told the truth usually become less cheerful.
<br>
Incorrect. The author makes no claim one way or another about the relationship of truth and cheer.

  <summary>Question 51</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: It supports the idea that current medical attitudes promote mistrust of the judgment of doctors.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the effect on the logic of the argument of a circumstance (an increase in medical malpractice litigation) mentioned in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It is inconsistent with the theme that doctors are deeply concerned about the welfare of their patients.
<br>
Incorrect. The increase in medical malpractice suits is not inconsistent with that theme of the argument, because patients can sue even when the doctor is deeply concerned about their welfare; deep concern does not guarantee good results, and people may sue based on results.
<br><br>
Option B: It weakens the premise that knowledge is the determinant of the ability of patients to cope with hospitalization.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not say that knowledge determines patients’ ability to cope with hospitalization; it says that it helps them cope with illness (paragraph 4). In any case, the number of lawsuits is not necessarily related to patients’ knowledge of their conditions.
<br><br>
Option C: It confirms the suggestion that doctors are violating the precept to do no harm.
<br>
Incorrect. Lawsuits are not necessarily related to whether or not doctors are violating the precept to do no harm.
<br><br>
Option D: It supports the idea that current medical attitudes promote mistrust of the judgment of doctors.
<br>
Correct. The passage clearly says that "The suspicion of deceit…contributes to the spiral of litigation" (final paragraph), so an increase in malpractice litigation would support the idea that current medical attitudes increase suspicion (that is, promote mistrust of the judgment of doctors).

  <summary>Question 52</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: “My body belongs to me!”

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the information and arguments in the passage to a novel scenario, which is not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: “Don’t trust MDs!”
<br>
Incorrect. This slogan is too broad; the trust discussed is limited to full disclosure of a person's condition (and does not, for example, encompass the adequacy of the recommended treatment).
<br><br>
Option B: “My body belongs to me!”
<br>
Correct. The author identifies invasion of patient autonomy as a significant consequence of doctors lying ; it "renders [patients] unable to make informed choices concerning their own health…" (paragraph 5)—or, in other words, concerning their own bodies. So, this slogan is appropriate because it claims ownership and, hence, the right to be informed in order to make decisions about one's body.
<br><br>
Option C: “Help those who can’t help themselves!”
<br>
Incorrect. This slogan is too narrow; the passage is not limited to those who can't help themselves.
<br><br>
Option D: “I have the right to die with dignity!”
<br>
Incorrect. This slogan is too narrow; the passage is not limited to issues of imminent death or the patient’s rights in that circumstance.
