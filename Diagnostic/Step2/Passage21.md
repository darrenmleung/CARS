# Passage 21
_Religion_ is difficult to define. If instead we adopt a functionalist approach and recognize that our religion is whatever system enables us to understand the world and our role in it, then it becomes obvious that the traditional religions are fulfilling their functions less and less; they are being supplanted by alternative systems. Today, the most powerful explanatory system is science, and the most attractive value system is consumerism. The academic offspring of these two orientations is economics, probably the most influential of the social sciences.

Functionally, the market capitalism of the United States is a religion. Its theology is the discipline of economics, and its god, the Market, a vicious circle of ever-increasing production and consumption, pretends to offer salvation for human discontent. Market capitalism is, in fact, becoming the first truly world religion, binding all corners of the globe more and more tightly into a worldview the religious role of which is overlooked only because its theologians persist in presenting it as secular. But the global victory of market capitalism does not mean that economic freedom is spreading to noncapitalists.

The capitalist theology is based on two counterintuitive but widely accepted propositions: that the Market is right and just (“The Market made me do it” is an acceptable defense for many morally questionable activities) and that value is adequately indicated by price. The assumption underlying both propositions is that the system is “natural.” Yet if the laws of market capitalism were as natural as those of physics or chemistry—if economics were a genuine science—its consequences would be unavoidable, even though they demonstrably intensify inequity and lead to environmental catastrophe.

Yet there is nothing inevitable about economic relationships. The current economic system reflects the ascendancy of a particular way of understanding and valuing the world, and its creed need not be accepted. Its ontology and ethics compete with other understandings of the world and the way that one should live in it. The most impressive aspect of market values is the extraordinary effectiveness and persuasiveness of their conversion techniques—the ubiquitous, hypnotic messages from every quarter: “buy _me_ if you want to be happy.”

A community is greater than the sum of its parts; the well-being of the whole is necessary for the well-being of each member. Contemporary economic theory cannot factor this truth into its equations because it remains in thrall to utilitarian values. According to utilitarianism, society is composed of autonomous individuals, each seeking personal ends. Human values are reduced to a calculus that maximizes pleasures (without distinguishing qualitatively among them) and minimizes discomfort. _Rationality_ is therefore defined as the methodical pursuit of one’s private gain.

Does this diminished worldview leave a place for the sacred—for wonder and awe before the majesty of creation? Whether or not one believes in an abiding and universal principle of goodness called _God_, one may suspect that something is missing. Sensing a lack in one’s life, one is reminded of a crucial role of religion: to raise fundamental questions about the world and the possibilities of one’s life.

Market capitalism is based on greed—greed for profit and greed for consumption. The spiritual problem with greed is the delusion that it is the means to happiness. This delusion reflects a defective value system, one based on an erroneous belief system. The atomistic individualism of utilitarianism must be challenged and refuted—not just intellectually but especially in the way that one lives one’s life. Fortunately, other worldviews exist that can still help us to do so.

  <summary>Question 116</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Greed is a natural aspect of human nature.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to identify a statement that is neither made nor implied in the passage. It is easier to be certain about which statements are made than about which are implied, so you will want to be especially careful in ruling out implications.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Market capitalism is based on false beliefs.
<br>
Incorrect. This statement is made in the passage: "Market capitalism is based on greed…the delusion that it is the means to happiness. This delusion reflects a defective value system, one based on an erroneous belief system" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: Greed is a natural aspect of human nature.
<br>
Correct. This point is neither stated nor implied in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: Economics describes social arrangements.
<br>
Incorrect. "The current economic system reflects … a particular way of understanding and valuing the world," and "competes with other understandings of the world <i>and the way one should live in it</i>" (paragraph 4, emphasis added). This implies that economics indeed addresses social arrangements.
<br><br>
Option D: Market capitalism is only one worldview.
<br>
Incorrect. This is stated in the passage: "Fortunately, other worldviews exist …" (final paragraph).

  <summary>Question 117</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: An intense protest by a concerned philosopher

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to characterize the tone and the approach of the passage and its author.

  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: An impassioned appeal by a religious leader
<br>
Incorrect. A religious leader would be unlikely to say that "Religion is difficult to define" (first paragraph); he or she would also be unlikely to adopt a functional definition of religion. Furthermore, the final sentence of the passage, expressing a main point, is not particularly impassioned.
<br><br>
Option B: An intense protest by a concerned philosopher
<br>
Correct. The protest element is clear from paragraph 4 through the end of the passage. In the final paragraph, for instance, the author writes: “Market capitalism is based on greed—greed for profit and greed for consumption.” A philosopher would be likely to examine and interrogate the underlying principles of religions, science, consumerism, and economics. For instance, the author writes: “Sensing a lack in one’s life, one is reminded of a crucial role of religion: to raise fundamental questions about the world and the possibilities of one’s life (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option C: A grim diatribe by an embittered social critic
<br>
  Incorrect. The final sentence is not at all grim: "<i>Fortunately</i>, other worldviews exist…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: A well reasoned analysis by an academic economist
<br>
Incorrect. It would be unlikely for an economist to call market capitalism a "religion"; it would also be unlikely for an economist to put forth the position described in the last two paragraphs, included the decrying of greed.

  <summary>Question 118</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: They can appropriate the other’s role because each offers a view of reality.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to examine the relationship the author implies or creates between two important concepts in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: They are mutually exclusive because they are competing value systems.
<br>
Incorrect. That they are competing value systems doesn't imply that they are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the author compares religion and science as explanatory systems, rather than as value systems.
<br><br>
Option B: They are independent because they operate on separate levels of reality.
<br>
Incorrect. The author indicates that both religion and science "[enable] us to understand the world and our role in it" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: They can be compatible if neither is allowed to determine one’s behavior.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: They can appropriate the other’s role because each offers a view of reality.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "…traditional religions… are being supplanted by alternative systems" (first paragraph). The alternative system the author mentions is science, and science can supplant religion because science, like religion, "enables us to understand the world and our role in it" (first paragraph); it is an "explanatory system."

  <summary>Question 119</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: They have accepted consumerism as their unacknowledged but real religion.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it provides information that goes beyond what is included in the passage, then asks you to assess how this information would affect passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: They are reluctant to admit doubts about the religious values that they profess.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not talk about people being reluctant to admit that they harbor religious doubt.
<br><br>
Option B: Their unhappiness is too profound to be relieved by the traditional religions.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not make this claim.
<br><br>
Option C: They have accepted consumerism as their unacknowledged but real religion.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "Functionally, the market capitalism of the United States is a religion.… ever-increasing production and consumption pretends to offer salvation for human discontent" (paragraph 2). The final paragraph indicates the failure of consumerism to provide such salvation (happiness, contentment, satisfaction).
<br><br>
Option D: They lack commitment to the values that are prevalent in their society.
<br>
Incorrect. The author would say just the opposite, that the prevalent values are those of consumers: "The current economic system reflects the ascendancy of a particular way of understanding and valuing the world" (paragraph 4). The author claims that people are committed to these consumerist values (note the word "ascendency"). The problem is that consumerism does not provide the promised satisfaction.

  <summary>Question 120</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: It implies a system of values.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to identify an unambiguous point made by the author in the text.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It implies a system of values.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "The current economic system reflects the ascendancy of a particular way of understanding and valuing the world, and its creed need not be accepted. Its ontology and ethics compete with other understandings of the world and the way that one should live in it” (paragraph 4). At various points in the passage, the author defines the values that he or she believes market capitalism promulgates (including that “value is adequately indicated by price,” in paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: It unites those who believe in it.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in the passage to support this option; in fact, the author says that contemporary economic theory is based on utilitarian values, in which case "society is composed of autonomous individuals" (paragraph 5), not united individuals.
<br><br>
Option C: It is defensible as just and right.
<br>
Incorrect. The author simply says market capitalism is "widely accepted" (paragraph 3); the rest of the passage suggest that it is not defensible.
<br><br>
Option D: It sets goals that transcend happiness.
<br>
Incorrect. Capitalism does not “transcend” happiness, in the author’s view; it promises happiness: "the most impressive aspect of market values…'buy <i>me</i> if you want to be happy'" (paragraph 4).

<details>
  <summary>Question 121</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: To satisfy a desire for education and travel

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it begins from passage information (the definition of utilitarianism, in this case) and asks you to apply this information to create a new scenario.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: To buy the possessions that other people seem to value
<br>
Incorrect. This does not capture the focus on "personal ends" (paragraph 5) that the author says is characteristic of utilitarianism.
<br><br>
Option B: To attain the medical care needed by a family member
<br>
Incorrect. This option overlooks the concern for "personal ends" (paragraph 5) that the author describes as characteristic of utilitarianism. Here, the medical care is needed "by a family member" and this option would mean that the person is thinking of what would benefit others.
<br><br>
Option C: To serve a practical purpose by benefiting a charity
<br>
Incorrect. Although this option refers to serving a “practical purpose,” and the author describes utilitarianism as having a focus on “rationality,” the author describes utilitarian rationality as still in thrall to personal desires, not altruism: “<i>Rationality</i> is therefore defined as the methodical pursuit of one’s private gain” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: To satisfy a desire for education and travel
<br>
Correct. This option incorporates "seeking personal ends" and maximizing (or at least seeking) pleasure (paragraph 5).

<details>
  <summary>Question 122</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: With curiosity about the expected financial returns on the investment

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which asks you to apply passage arguments to make a prediction or inference about a situation not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: With caution because the need for organ transplants might exceed their availability
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes the market capitalist as expressing a purely practical concern; it does not convey the concern for personal gain (paragraph 5) or greed (final paragraph) associated by the author with market capitalism.
<br><br>
Option B: With uncertainty about the morality of profiting from medical emergencies
<br>
Incorrect. The author implies throughout the passage that questions of morality are not a central part of market capitalism. For instance, the author writes that “The Market made me do it” is an acceptable defense for many morally questionable activities and that value is adequately indicated by price (paragraph 3). Thus, a response dominated by moral concerns is not predicted by the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: With curiosity about the expected financial returns on the investment
<br>
Correct. This option captures both the emphasis on personal or private gain (paragraph 5) and the greed (final paragraph) associated by the author with market capitalism.
<br><br>
Option D: With enthusiasm because such a market would benefit humanity
<br>
Incorrect. The idea that a market capitalist would be primarily concerned with benefitting humanity contradicts the focus on personal or private gain that the author considers a hallmark of market capitalism (paragraph 5).
