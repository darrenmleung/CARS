# Passage 10
The fact that in our time the teaching of reading and writing and the teaching of the way to interpret literary works are divided between the lower and the higher levels of the educational system has perhaps blinded us to the real historical motives of canon formation and to the relations among literature, language, and the social structure. More important, we have yet to acknowledge or to explain fully the relation between literature and society, a relation mediated by the school as the institution of linguistic control. Literature and language have marched through history in tandem with one another, and yesterday’s literature has become today’s grammar. The language of societies with written literatures has thus tended to become internally stratified according to the groups among the population that have access to the school and the amount of access each has.

Since the eighteenth century, the social stratification of speech has corresponded roughly with the level of class and less and less with gender—hence the growing number of canonical women authors over the last two centuries. (This increase does not mean that the system for the regulation of reading and writing no longer continues to impose particular constraints upon women who write but that the process of canon formation is remarkable for having failed to exclude women.)

If the educational system has now become so complex that the historical relation between literature and grammar is easy to forget, one reason for this amnesia is that grammar is now so codified and routinized at the lower levels that it is no longer necessary to use canonical literary texts in order to teach it at all. But this situation has itself been necessitated by the fact that older works of English literature are too remote linguistically to serve as models of grammar, and thus our conception of “correct” English has come to be based on the literary prose of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries rather than the works of the Middle Ages or the Renaissance.

One consequence of this circumstance is that over the last hundred years, the major canonical works have defined the syllabus at the higher levels of the system, while at the lower levels, the canon itself has been gradually replaced by a range of children’s and adolescents’ works useful for disseminating basic literacy because of their relative verbal simplicity (one thinks in this connection of the short stories of O. Henry, of the poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson, or of J. D. Salinger’s _The Catcher in the Rye_).

When students (not everyone, of course) come to study the major canonical works at the secondary or university levels of the system, they are able to acquire a sophistication about language presumably greater than the simple literacy, or Standard English, of the lower levels. They learn a “literary” style of speaking and writing, which is more than merely correct, more than merely an accurate reproduction of such prose paradigms as are still used in “composition” courses. This more sophisticated linguistic facility is signaled in many ways—for example, by the capacity to recognize quotations from canonical literature, recognition that subtly broadcasts an advanced level of educational acquisition.

Whatever else an individual might do with the real knowledge conveyed by the school, this linguistic facility is an example of what the school does socially for the individual. Now, as always, the school reproduces the stratified structure of the social order. And within this institutional structure, the literary curriculum performs this function primarily by producing distinctive forms of linguistic knowledge.

  <summary>Question 53</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: books written for children and adolescents.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to assess the options to determine which option provides evidence that would support the passage claim referred to in the stem.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: books written for children and adolescents.
<br>
Correct. The point about the linguistic goals of lower and higher levels of education, respectively, is supported by comparing the passage descriptions of the linguistic goals of each level: "…children's and adolescents' works useful for disseminating basic literacy because of their relative verbal simplicity…" (paragraph 4); "when students…study…at the secondary or university levels of the system, they are able to acquire a sophistication about language presumably greater than the simple literacy…of the lower levels…" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option B: the number of canonical women authors.
<br>
Incorrect. The number of canonical women authors (increasing over the last two centuries, according to paragraph 2) is irrelevant to the different linguistic goals of the lower and higher levels of education.
<br><br>
Option C: the language of societies with written literatures.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant to the different linguistic goals of the lower and higher levels of education.
<br><br>
Option D: works of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
<br>
Incorrect. The author implies that teaching grammar is a goal at the lower levels (paragraph 3) and that doing so has become so codified and routinized that "it is no longer necessary to use canonical literary texts" (paragraph 3). The author then mentions works of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, explaining that these works cannot serve as models of grammar. These references are not meant to differentiate between the goals of the lower and higher levels of education, but to explain why "our conception of 'correct' English has come to be based on the literary prose of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries rather than the works of the Middle Ages or the Renaissance" (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 54</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: list of influential literary texts.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to use passage context to understand how the author uses or deploys a particular term.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: sophisticated understanding of language.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says that when students study the canon, they acquire a sophisticated understanding of language (paragraph 5), not that the canon is a sophisticated understanding of language.
<br><br>
Option B: codified grammar.
<br>
Incorrect. The author mentions codified grammar to describe the teaching of grammar at the lower levels of education (paragraph 3), not to describe the canon.
<br><br>
Option C: list of influential literary texts.
<br>
Correct. "…the major canonical works have defined the syllabus at the higher levels of the system" (paragraph 4); this indicates that they are indeed influential literary texts.
<br><br>
Option D: literate style of speech.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says that a literate style of speech is learned as a result of studying the canon, not that the canon is a literate style of speech.

  <summary>Question 55</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: I and III only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it introduces a new piece of information, not discussed in the passage, then asks you to use this new information and passage information to make further inferences.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: II only
<br>
Incorrect. The author says that "older works of English literature are too remote linguistically to serve as models of grammar" (paragraph 3), so students who read older literature would be less, not more, literate than students who read modern literature. Hence II is incorrect.
<br><br>
Option B: III only
<br>
Incorrect. III is correct, but I is also correct.
<br><br>
Option C: I and II only
<br>
Incorrect. I is correct, but II is incorrect. (The author says that "older works of English literature are too remote linguistically to serve as models of grammar" (paragraph 3), so students who read older literature would be less, not more, literate than students who read modern literature. Hence II is incorrect.)
<br><br>
Option D: I and III only
<br>
Correct. I is correct, because if the need for basic literacy instruction determines the literature taught in schools, then the books in school libraries (presumably taught in schools) would be an index of the literacy level. If the books in the libraries changed, then this would constitute evidence that the literacy level had changed as well. III is correct because if the need for basic literacy instruction is what determines the books that are taught in schools, then vocabulary level (directly related to literacy instruction) will be considered more of a priority when books are selected for classrooms than “literary merit,” which is more distantly related to basic literacy instruction, according to paragraph 5.

  <summary>Question 56</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: The canon is determined by literary critics.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, because it asks you to identify statements that are—and are not--in agreement with information in the passage. This question tests your basic understanding of passage components.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The canon is determined by literary critics.
<br>
Correct. This is not in agreement with passage information. The passage does not specify how canonical works become canonical.
<br><br>
Option B: O. Henry is taught in high schools.
<br>
Incorrect. This is in accord with the author's mention of O. Henry as an example of children's or adolescents' works being useful for disseminating basic literacy (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: Speech differences correspond to social class differences.
<br>
Incorrect. This is in accord with the last sentence in paragraph 5: "This more sophisticated linguistic facility is signaled in many ways—for example, by the capacity to recognize quotations from canonical literature, recognition that subtly broadcasts an advanced level of educational acquisition" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: The canon influences the college English curriculum.
<br>
Incorrect. This is in accord with the first sentence in paragraph 4: "…the major canonical works have defined the syllabus at the higher levels of the system."

  <summary>Question 57</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: restrict certain knowledge to the upper classes.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the author’s perspective or opinion on a topic discussed in the passage by making inferences and integrating information from throughout the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: restrict certain knowledge to the upper classes.
<br>
Correct. This is supported by the claim: "The language of societies with written literatures has tended to become internally stratified according to the groups among the population that have access to the school and the amount of access each has" (first paragraph). This option is also supported by the final paragraph: "Now, as always, the school reproduces the stratified structure of the social order. And within this institutional structure, the literary curriculum performs this function primarily by producing distinctive forms of linguistic knowledge" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: obscure the relationship between literature and language.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says "Literature and language have marched through history in tandem with one another and yesterday's literature has become today's grammar" (first paragraph) and nothing about obscuring the relationship between the two, let alone suggesting that that is the motive of canon formation.
<br><br>
Option C: increase literacy among the underprivileged.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage suggests the opposite, that literacy was increased among the privileged for they had access to school (first paragraph).
<br><br>
  Option D: exclude writers from the <i>working</i> class from the canon.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage suggests an exclusion of the working class from the canon, due to limited access to literacy and school; it says nothing about writers from the working class.

  <summary>Question 58</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: Only the college-educated members of an audience laughed when the speaker alluded to a humorous situation in a Dickens novel.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which asks you to assess which novel scenario not included in the passage would support passage claims.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Bookstores sell more copies of O. Henry’s Short Stories than of any fiction written before the twentieth century.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant because the passage is limited in its scope to literature taught in schools.
<br><br>
Option B: A linguist counted over a hundred instances of poor grammar in a popular half-hour television program.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant because the passage focuses on the literary canon, not on popular culture.
<br><br>
Option C: Most advanced degrees are earned by students from families that are relatively prosperous.
<br>
Incorrect. Although this option captures the relationship between access to higher education and social stratification, it provides no support for the author's thesis about the literary canon.
<br><br>
Option D: Only the college-educated members of an audience laughed when the speaker alluded to a humorous situation in a Dickens novel.
<br>
Correct. This supports the author's contention that "the school reproduces the stratified structure of the social order" (final paragraph). This option provides a supporting example similar to that in the passage at the end of paragraph 5 about the capacity of those who have studied canonical literature to recognize quotations from that literature.
