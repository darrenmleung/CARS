# Passage 26
The training of Victorian girls in repression, concealment, and self-censorship was deeply inhibiting, especially for those who wanted to write. As the novelist Jane Vaughan Pinckney commented in 1860, “Women are greater dissemblers than men when they wish to conceal their own emotions. By habit, moral training, and modern education, they are obliged to do so. The very first lessons of infancy teach them to repress their feelings, control their very thoughts.” The verbal range permitted to English gentlewomen amounted almost to a special language. The verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady were reinforced by the critics’ vigilance. “It is an immense loss,” lamented Alice James, “to have all robust and sustaining expletives refined away from one.” “Coarseness” was the term Victorian readers used to rebuke unconventional language in women’s literature. It could refer to the “damns” in _Jane Eyre_, the dialect in _Wuthering Heights_, the slang of Rhoda Broughton’s heroines, the colloquialisms in _Aurora Leigh_, or more generally to the moral tone of a work, such as the “vein of perilous voluptuousness” one alert critic detected in _Adam Bede_. While verbal force, wit, and originality in women were criticized, a bland and gelatinous prose won applause. “She writes as an English gentlewoman should write,” the _North British Review_ complimented Anne Marsh in 1849; “her pages are absolutely like green pastures.” Reduced to a pastoral flatness, deprived of a language in which to describe their bodies or the events of their bodies, denied the expression of pain as well as the expression of pleasure, women writers appeared deficient in passion.

Florence Nightingale thought the effort of repression itself drained off women’s creative energy. “Give us back our suffering,” she demanded in _Cassandra_ (1852), “for out of nothing comes nothing. But out of suffering may come the cure. Better have pain than paralysis.” It does sometimes seem as if feminine writers are metaphorically paralyzed by refinement and restraint, but the repression in which the feminine novel was situated also forced women to find innovative and covert ways to dramatize the inner life, and led to a fiction that was intense, compact, symbolic, and profound. There is Charlotte Brontë’s extraordinary subversion of the Gothic in _Jane Eyre_, in which the mad wife locked in the attic symbolizes the passionate and sexual side of Jane’s personality, an alter ego that her upbringing, her religion, and her society have commanded her to incarcerate.

Many of the fantasies of feminine novels are related to money, mobility, and power. Although feminine novelists punished assertive heroines, they dealt with personal ambition by projecting the ideology of success onto male characters, whose initiative, thrift, industry, and perseverance came straight from the woman author’s experience. The “woman’s man” was often a more effective outlet for the “deviant” aspects of the author’s personality than were her heroines.

  <summary>Question 147</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: constrained by prevailing attitudes about the kind of language considered appropriate for women to use.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that asks you to identify the main argument of the passage, which requires you to recognize the answer as a paraphrase of the author’s writing.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: criticized for the blandness that resulted from the effect of repression on women's creative energies.
<br>
Incorrect. The author writes that, to the contrary, for women "…a bland and gelatinous prose won applause" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: concerned mainly with issues of money, mobility, and power as they related to the male characters.
<br>
Incorrect. This is a consequence of the author's main point: because women writers couldn't address those issues as they related to themselves, they had to "project the ideology of success onto male characters" (final paragraph); it is not the main point itself.
<br><br>
Option C: constrained by prevailing attitudes about the kind of language considered appropriate for women to use.
<br>
Correct. The author makes this point clear in the opening of the passage: "The training of Victorian girls in repression, concealment, and self-censorship was deeply inhibiting, especially for those who wanted to write…. The verbal range permitted…amounted almost to a special language" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: praised only when their authors found innovative ways to dramatize their inner lives and the events of their bodies.
<br>
Incorrect. Instead, for women writers: "…originality…[was] criticized…" (first paragraph).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 148</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: I and II only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a relatively straightforward Comprehension question; it asks you to locate points that the author makes in the passage and the language in the option is close to that used in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: III only
<br>
Incorrect. "The very first lessons of infancy teach them to repress their feelings, control their very thoughts" (first paragraph); this shows that repression was encouraged, required, not considered deviant, and thus III is incorrect.
<br><br>
Option B: I and II only
<br>
Correct. Because the author tells us that female novelists "punished assertive heroines" and "dealt with personal ambition by projecting the ideology of success onto male characters, whose initiative, thrift, industry, and perseverance came straight from the woman author's experience" (final paragraph), one can infer that both assertiveness and ambition, as well as initiative and thrift, were considered deviant for the female author. Thus, I and II are correct. This is further supported by the next sentence in the passage: "The 'woman's man' was often a more effective outlet for the 'deviant' aspects of the author's personality than were her heroines" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: I and III only
<br>
Incorrect. Although I is correct, III is not: "The very first lessons of infancy teach [women] to repress their feelings, control their very thoughts" (first paragraph); this shows that repression was encouraged, rather than considered deviant.
<br><br>
Option D: I, II, and III
<br>
Incorrect. Although I and II are correct, III is not: "The very first lessons of infancy teach [women] to <i>repress</i> their feelings, control their very thoughts" (first paragraph); this shows that repression was encouraged, rather than considered deviant.

  <summary>Question 149</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: I, II, and III

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that tests your understanding of causal claims that are stated by the author and require you to recognize some paraphrases of the author’s own language.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: II only
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s reference to "[t] he verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady…" (first paragraph) suggests that I is also correct. And "The training of Victorian girls in … <i>self-censorship</i> was deeply inhibiting, especially for those who wanted to write" (first paragraph) suggests that III is also correct.
<br><br>
Option B: I and III only
<br>
Incorrect. "The verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady were reinforced by the critics' vigilance" (first paragraph) suggests that II is also correct.
<br><br>
Option C: II and III only
<br>
"The verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady…" (first paragraph) suggests that I is also correct.
<br><br>
Option D: I, II, and III
<br>
  Correct. "The verbal inhibitions that were <i>part of the upbringing</i> of a lady…" (first paragraph) indicates that I is correct. "The verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady <i>were reinforced by the critics' vigilance</i>" (first paragraph) demonstrates that II is also correct. "The training of Victorian girls in…<i>self-censorship</i> was deeply inhibiting, especially for those who wanted to write" shows that III is also correct.

  <summary>Question 150</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: displayed a bland, pastoral flatness in its prose.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to recognize a point made explicitly by the author in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: displayed a bland, pastoral flatness in its prose.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "…a bland and gelatinous prose won applause" (first paragraph) and suggests that the language of women writers was often "reduced to a pastoral flatness…" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: employed unusual language or characters.
<br>
Incorrect. To the contrary, "…verbal force, wit, and originality in women were criticized…" (paragraph 1).
<br><br>
Option C: was intense, compact, symbolic, or profound.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does say that women's writing could be "intense, compact, symbolic, and profound" (paragraph 2), but also that such writing was "covert"—so it would not have been praised.
<br><br>
Option D: was written out of a deep sense of suffering.
<br>
Incorrect. It is plausible that some Victorian women's writing was written out of a deep sense of suffering, but because women writers were "denied the expression of pain" (first paragraph), the author certainly does not suggest that their work was praised for the suffering behind it.

<details>
  <summary>Question 151</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: disguise certain aspects of their female characters’ personalities.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to evaluate the relationship of parts of the passage argument. To answer the question, you must evaluate the function of the discussion referred to in the stem, then assess its relevance to aspects of the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: write in a way that made them appear deficient in passion.
<br>
Incorrect. The opening paragraph indicates that women writers were expected to write in a way that made them appear deficient in passion, but in the case of Bronte's “subversion of the Gothic,” the passage tells us that she creates a very “passionate” character (paragraph 2), so that discussion is not particularly relevant to this passage claim.
<br><br>
Option B: express certain personality traits through male surrogates.
<br>
Incorrect. This point is conveyed in the final paragraph, but the question asks about Brontë's subversion of the Gothic (paragraph 2). According to the passage, Bronte expressed her passion through the character of the “mad wife”—to the extent that wives are female, this strategy meant that Bronte expressed “certain personality traits” through female rather than male surrogates.
<br><br>
Option C: disguise certain aspects of their female characters’ personalities.
<br>
  Correct. The author writes that in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the "mad wife locked in the attic symbolizes the passionate and sexual side of Jane's personality, an alter ego that her upbringing, her religion, and her society have commanded her to incarcerate" (paragraph 2); Bronte thus disguised her own passion and sexuality as that of her character. Or, as the author puts it: “the repression in which the feminine novel was situated also forced women to find innovative and covert ways to dramatize the inner life” (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option D: avoid coarseness in their choice of dialect or moral tone.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing about the description of the “mad wife” that is relevant to the avoidance of coarseness.

<details>
  <summary>Question 152</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: Yes; the example of Adam Bede supports the claim.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the degree of evidentiary support for a passage claim.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: No; the claim is simply stated without support.
<br>
  Incorrect. The claim is supported by the example of <i>Adam Bede</i> (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: No; the quotation from Alice James effectively refutes the claim.
<br>
Incorrect. Alice James’s quotation is evidence of what was generally expected of women in their speech, which James saw as impoverishing women’s verbal resources: “The verbal inhibitions that were part of the upbringing of a lady were reinforced by the critics’ vigilance. “It is an immense loss,” lamented Alice James, “to have all robust and sustaining expletives refined away from one” (first paragraph). The quotation does not provide evidence of the moral tone to which critics objected.
<br><br>
  Option C: Yes; the example of <i>Aurora Leigh</i> supports the claim.
<br>
  Incorrect. The example of <i>Aurora Leigh</i> addresses colloquialisms (first paragraph).
<br><br>
  Option D: Yes; the example of <i>Adam Bede</i> supports the claim.
<br>
Correct. The author indicates that some critics objected to "…the moral tone of a work, such as the 'vein of perilous voluptuousness' one alert critic detected in <i>Adam Bede</i>" (first paragraph). The author, then, gives an example of a critic finding in a specific text a problematic or objectionable “moral tone,” in this case, presumably too much concern with sensuality.

  <summary>Question 153</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: The critics would have faulted the novel for its coarseness.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which asks you to use passage claims to make a prediction about how a particular hypothetical situation (not discussed in the text) would develop.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The critics would have ignored the novel because it was written by a woman.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage doesn't say that all novels by women are ignored; on the contrary, it mentions several novels by Victorian women that received not only attention, but praise.
<br><br>
Option B: The critics would have faulted the novel for its coarseness.
<br>
Correct. "'Coarseness' was the term Victorian readers used to rebuke unconventional language in women's literature" and "could refer to…the colloquialisms in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>..." (first paragraph)
<br><br>
Option C: The critics would have praised the novel for its intensity and profundity.
<br>
Incorrect. "Intensity" and "profundity" are used in the passage to describe fiction that dramatized the inner life; they do not refer to reproducing the colloquial speech.
<br><br>
  Option D: The critics would have compared the novel favorably to <i>Aurora Leigh</i>.
<br>
  Incorrect. The author tells us that <i>Aurora Leigh</i> was <i>criticized</i> for its colloquialisms—an instance of “coarseness” in women’s writing being censured. The novel described in the stem, then, would be likely to receive the same negative treatment. It would not be compared favorably to <i>Aurora Leigh</i>.

<details>
  <summary>Question 154</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: more creative.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply information in the passage to predict the outcome of a situation that is not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: more creative.
<br>
Correct. "Florence Nightingale thought the effort of repression itself drained off women's creative energy" (paragraph 2), so if women were permitted to write more freely, without repression, their work would be more creative.
<br><br>
Option B: more restrained.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option C: less subversive.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option. Based on Nightingale’s belief that repression depleted women’s creative energy, it is likely that additional freedom would make their work more, rather than less, subversive, as women would be navigating less strict guidelines for what was permissible in their writing.
<br><br>
Option D: less innovative.
<br>
Incorrect. "Florence Nightingale thought the effort of repression itself drained off women's creative energy" (paragraph 2), so if they were permitted to write more freely, without repression, their work would be <i>more creative</i>—which is the opposite of <i>less innovative</i>.

  <summary>Question 155</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: may harm one artist’s creativity while enhancing another’s resourcefulness.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the author’s arguments to make a prediction about something beyond what is discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: leads inevitably to mental illness.
<br>
  Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option. The “mad wife” is a <i>character</i> in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and we are not told the cause of her ostensible mental illness.
<br><br>
Option B: does great damage to the creativity of both men and women.
<br>
Incorrect. Men's creativity is not mentioned in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: serves to make women more creative than men.
<br>
Incorrect. Men's creativity is not discussed in the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: may harm one artist’s creativity while enhancing another’s resourcefulness.
<br>
Correct. "It does sometimes seem as if feminine writers are metaphorically paralyzed by refinement and restraint, but the repression in which the feminine novel was situated also forced women to find innovative and covert ways to dramatize the inner life…" (paragraph 2).

  <summary>Question 156</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Victorian society placed restrictions on the type of behavior and language appropriate for women.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it begins by providing information not discussed in the passage and then asks you to consider how that information would affect the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the “woman’s man” was often an effective outlet for certain aspects of a woman writer’s personality.
<br>
Incorrect. Southey's comments do not touch on the “woman’s man,” as this figure is discussed in the passage; Southey instead focuses on what he sees as the problems that a literary life creates for a woman.
<br><br>
Option B: Victorian society placed restrictions on the type of behavior and language appropriate for women.
<br>
Correct. Southey’s comments clearly provide an example of the belief that certain kinds of thought, promoted by the life of a writer, are inappropriate for a woman. This supports passage claims about the kind of constraints that Victorian women negotiated: “The training of Victorian girls in repression, concealment, and self-censorship was deeply inhibiting, especially for those who wanted to write” (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: repression could sometimes lead to intensity and compactness in novels written by Victorian women.
<br>
Incorrect. Southey recommends that women should not write; his comments do not support a claim about the literary resources that repression could enable.
<br><br>
Option D: refinement and restraint led some Victorian women writers to become metaphorically paralyzed.
<br>
Incorrect. Southey recommends that women should not write; his words do not support a claim about the effects on Victorian women writers of choosing repression and restraint.
