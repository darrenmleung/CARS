# Passage 6
Morality is generally concerned with right and wrong conduct or behavior and good and bad character. It is on the basis of a person's conduct (deeds, _nneyëe_) that the Akans (a people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast) judge one to be good or bad, to have good character or bad character....

The emphasis on the relevance of actions for states of character is reflected in the way that abstract terms for "goodness," "virtue," are formed. The usual words for "goodness" in Akan are _yieyë_ and _papayë_. The last syllable of each word means to do or perform. Thus, the two words literally mean "good-doing" (that is, doing good).

The Akan position is that the original nature of human beings was morally neutral. If this were not the case, there would be no such thing as a moral person. The person's original moral neutrality later comes to be affected by actions, habits, responses to moral instruction, and so on. Consequently, what a person does or does not do is crucial to the formation of the character. A virtuous character is the result of the performance of virtuous acts.

There is one difficult question inherent in the Akan position, a question that has not been squarely faced or examined by scholars. The question is this: How are we to perform virtuous acts if we are not already virtuous?

The answer is through moral instruction, which in traditional Akan society was normally done by means of ethical proverbs and folktales. In this way, the growing child and young adult become aware of what is a virtuous or vicious act and become virtuous by performing virtuous acts.

In dealing with the further question of how a person can perform such acts, the role of the _sunsum_ in a person's psychological system must be considered. A person's _sunsum_ (spirit) plays a role in the formation and exercise of character (_suban_), which means that sunsum, considered as a capacity, enables a person to perform virtuous acts. One might regard the position of the Akan traditional thinker here as less than adequate on the grounds that capacity or power does not exist in the same degree in different individuals. In fact, the idea of different degrees of capacity in individuals is reflected in such Akan locutions as "strong _sunsum_," "forceful _sunsum_," "weak _sunsum_," and so on.

However, whatever a person's capacity, the Akans believe that the _sunsum_ can be developed. A weak _sunsum_ can be strengthened by making an effort, and by making an effort a person can obey a moral rule, either by doing what is right or refraining from doing what is wrong. Thus, while none of the moral virtues is implanted in us by nature, nature gives us the capacity to acquire them. However, the Akan thinker's position here cannot claim to be final and impregnable, for we can still pose the questions: Is it not the case that making an effort itself requires or presupposes antecedent factors? If so, what are these factors and how can they be acquired? The attempt to answer this set of questions will most probably involve us in a circle, and a vicious one.

  <li>A child is told a tale about a character who is punished for performing a vicious act; the child learns not to follow the character's example.</li>
</ol>

### 30. According to the passage, one problem with Akan moral philosophy is that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>it makes character too dependent on exposure to ethical proverbs and folktales.</li>
  <li>it ignores the fact that if people can receive moral instruction, then they are not morally neutral.</li>
  <li>the Akans cannot explain how people can make an effort to be virtuous without already being virtuous.</li>
  <li>the Akans believe that people can change their character.</li>
</ol>

### 31. The author's discussion of the Akan words for "goodness" (paragraph 2) is used primarily as evidence that the Akans believe that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>one cannot perform virtuous acts unless one is already virtuous.</li>
  <li>morality is generally concerned with good or bad character.</li>
  <li>character is directly related to action.</li>
  <li>humans are born morally neutral.</li>
</ol>

### 32. Which of the following statements, if true, would most help to resolve the author's difficulty with the Akan position as expressed in the final paragraph?
<ol type="A">
  <li>The ability to make an effort is present in equal strength among all persons.</li>
  <li>By making an effort to do right or refrain from doing wrong, one can obey moral rules.</li>
  <li>Making an effort requires strengthening of the <i>sunsum</i>.</li>
  <li>The ability to make an effort can be instilled only through moral education.</li>

### 33. According to the passage, the Akans hold that adults can be considered moral or immoral only because all people are:
<ol type="A">
  <li>born with different degrees of <i>sunsum</i>.</li>
  <li>born morally neutral.</li>
  <li>equally susceptible to moral education.</li>
  <li>equally capable of making an effort.</li>

  <li>Akan ethical thought is superior to Western ethical thought.</li>
  <li>the act of making an effort is self-motivating.</li>
  <li>something must cause people to make an effort.</li>
</ol>

### 35. Assume that a person who committed violent crimes as a youth later became gentle and loving after receiving moral instruction. This information most strongly supports the Akans' view that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>human beings are born morally neutral.</li>
  <li>a person's <i>sunsum</i> can be developed.</li>
  <li>a person becomes virtuous by performing virtuous acts.</li>
  <li>good or bad character is dependent on a person's conduct.</li>
</ol>

  <li>have the capacity to change their behavior.</li>
  <li>did not receive traditional moral instruction.</li>
  <li>have weak <i>sunsum</i>.</li>
  <li>have weak <i>suban</i>.</li>

# Answers

  <summary>Question 29</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: A child is told a tale about a character who is punished for performing a vicious act; the child learns not to follow the character's example.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the arguments in the passage to assess which novel scenario is most consistent with passage claims.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: A child is told a tale about a character who is born morally neutral; the child learns that such a character can never become virtuous.
<br>
Incorrect. To the contrary, the passage talks about the potential for moral improvement in this Akan scheme (paragraph 5), so moral instruction does not teach that virtue cannot be gained.
<br><br>
Option B: A child is told a tale about a character who performs a virtuous act; the child learns that only people who are born virtuous can perform virtuous acts.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage clearly indicates that the Akan believe that a person can "become virtuous by performing virtuous acts" (paragraph 5), which is contradicted by this option.
<br><br>
Option C: A child is told a tale that illustrates the difference between a character who has weak <i>sunsum</i> and one who has strong <i>sunsum</i>; the child learns that the character with weak <i>sunsum</i> can never become virtuous.
<br>
Incorrect. According to the passage, the Akan believe that a person can "become virtuous by performing virtuous acts" (paragraph 5); this is not limited to those with strong <i>sunsum</i>, as the author describes <i>sunsum</i> in paragraph 6.
<br><br>
Option D: A child is told a tale about a character who is punished for performing a vicious act; the child learns not to follow the character's example.
<br>
Correct. The passage says that "the growing child and young adult become aware of what is a virtuous or vicious act" (paragraph 5); although punishment is not mentioned, it can still be considered an instance of moral instruction since the child learns not to follow the character's vicious example.

  <summary>Question 30</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: the Akans cannot explain how people can make an effort to be virtuous without already being virtuous.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to locate a point that the author makes explicitly in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: it makes character too dependent on exposure to ethical proverbs and folktales.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not treat this as a “problem.”
<br><br>
Option B: it ignores the fact that if people can receive moral instruction, then they are not morally neutral.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not “ignore” this question but instead addresses it directly. The author writes: “The Akan position is that the <i>original</i> nature of human beings was morally neutral . . . The person's original moral neutrality later comes to be affected by actions, habits, responses to moral instruction, and so on” (paragraph 3, emphasis added).
<br><br>
Option C: the Akans cannot explain how people can make an effort to be virtuous without already being virtuous.
<br>
Correct. The author comments: "There is one difficult question inherent in the Akan position … How are we to perform virtuous acts if we are not already virtuous?" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option D: the Akans believe that people can change their character.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not treat this as a “problem” with their moral philosophy, but as an important part of the philosophy: “what a person does or does not do is crucial to the formation of the character. A virtuous character is the result of the performance of virtuous <i>acts</i>” (paragraph 3).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 31</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: character is directly related to action.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to look at a section of the passage and determine how the author uses this section as evidence. In addition, it asks you to assess how this evidence is most importantly used by the author.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: one cannot perform virtuous acts unless one is already virtuous.
<br>
Incorrect. The discussion of “goodness” is not used to make this point, and this point is not an absolute one in the passage, in any case.
<br><br>
Option B: morality is generally concerned with good or bad character.
<br>
Incorrect. This point is established in the first paragraph, but the discussion of goodness occurs in paragraph 2, and it shows "the emphasis on the relevance of actions" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option C: character is directly related to action.
<br>
Correct. The discussion of “goodness” in paragraph 2 emphasizes the importance of action: "The emphasis on the relevance of actions for states of character is reflected in the way that abstract terms for "goodness" … are formed. … The last syllable … means to do or perform. …” This is ultimately used to support the point in paragraph 3 that in the Akan philosophy “what a person does or does not do is crucial to the formation of the character. A virtuous character is the result of the performance of virtuous <i>acts</i>.”
<br><br>
Option D: humans are born morally neutral.
<br>
Incorrect. That the Akan believe that humans are born morally neutral is not a point supported by the discussion of goodness, which is about the relevance of action in becoming morally good.

  <summary>Question 32</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: The ability to make an effort is present in equal strength among all persons.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to assess which novel option could be incorporated into the passage in order to address or resolve a problem the author articulates in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The ability to make an effort is present in equal strength among all persons.
<br>
Correct. The author’s “difficulty” is this: “Is it not the case that making an effort itself requires or presupposes antecedent factors? If so, what are these factors and how can they be acquired? The attempt to answer this set of questions will most probably involve us in a circle, and a vicious one” (final paragraph). If everyone possesses the capacity to make an effort in equal measure, everyone would have an equal capacity to develop <i>sunsum</i> and so to become good or bad; this option eliminates the circularity.
<br><br>
Option B: By making an effort to do right or refrain from doing wrong, one can obey moral rules.
<br>
Incorrect. This does not resolve the difficulty of the first question posed in the final paragraph.
<br><br>
  Option C: Making an effort requires strengthening of the <i>sunsum</i>.
<br>
  Incorrect. This does not resolve the circularity (making an effort <i>strengthens the sunsum</i>, as the author explains in the final paragraph), but this option says that making an effort <i>requires strengthening of the sunsum</i>.
<br><br>
Option D: The ability to make an effort can be instilled only through moral education.
<br>
Incorrect. This does not resolve the difficulty of the questions posed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 33</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: born morally neutral.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to locate information that the author states in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: born with different degrees of <i>sunsum</i>.
<br>
  Incorrect. The passage says that the Akan believe that the <i>sunsum</i> can be developed (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: born morally neutral.
<br>
Correct. "The Akan position is that the original nature of human beings was morally neutral. If this were not the case, there would be no such thing as a moral person" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option C: equally susceptible to moral education.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not make this claim.
<br><br>
Option D: equally capable of making an effort.
<br>
Incorrect. In the final paragraph, the author discusses the value of “making an effort” to develop moral virtue but the author does not say that everyone has equal capacity to make an effort.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 34</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: something must cause people to make an effort.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to make an inference about the author’s thinking based on the author’s explicit claims.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: no ethical system is final and unassailable.
<br>
Incorrect. The author merely says that the Akan system is not final (final paragraph), not that no ethical system can be this way.
<br><br>
Option B: Akan ethical thought is superior to Western ethical thought.
<br>
Incorrect. The author makes no such comparative statement.
<br><br>
Option C: the act of making an effort is self-motivating.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not make this claim.
<br><br>
Option D: something must cause people to make an effort.
<br>
Correct. This assumption is clear in the author's question: "Is it not the case that making an effort itself requires or presupposes antecedent factors?" (final paragraph).

<details>
  <summary>Question 35</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: a person's sunsum can be developed.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider the effect on the passage of a variety of hypothetical circumstances not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: human beings are born morally neutral.
<br>
Incorrect. The Akan view is that everyone is born morally neutral and is capable of becoming good or bad; committing bad acts and then good ones doesn't support the view that one is born morally neutral.
<br><br>
Option B: a person's sunsum can be developed.
<br>
Correct. That a person can become good after committing bad acts supports the view that a person's sunsum can be developed, as the sunsum plays a role in the formation and exercise of character (paragraph 6), "which means that sunsum … enables a person to perform virtuous acts."
<br><br>
Option C: a person becomes virtuous by performing virtuous acts.
<br>
Incorrect. This is the Akan view, according to the passage, but it is not supported by the moral change described in the stem. The change described in the passage requires receiving moral instruction and doesn’t focus only on how one acts.
<br><br>
Option D: good or bad character is dependent on a person's conduct.
<br>
Incorrect. This is the Akan view, according to the passage, but it is not supported by the moral transformation described in the question.

<details>
  <summary>Question 36</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: have the capacity to change their behavior.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to consider the logical relations between elements of the author’s argument and to consider their implications as well.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: have the capacity to change their behavior.
<br>
  Correct. The author writes that: "…the Akans believe that the <i>sunsum</i> can be developed…" (final paragraph) and that "…by making an effort a person can obey a moral rule…" (final paragraph). From these explicit statements about the Akan belief in the capacity for change, it follows that one can be held responsible for failing to exercise that capacity.
<br><br>
Option B: did not receive traditional moral instruction.
<br>
Incorrect. If people did not receive traditional moral instruction, and if that is the route to virtuous acts (paragraphs 4 and 5), then they <i>cannot</i> be blamed for their actions.
<br><br>
  Option C: have weak <i>sunsum</i>.
<br>
Incorrect. Since the passage indicates that the Akan believe that one can develop one's <i>sunsum</i>, it's not the <i>sunsum</i> per se that offers the justification for blame, but the failure to develop that <i>sunsum</i>.
<br><br>
  Option D: have weak <i>suban</i>.
<br>
  Incorrect. A weak <i>suban</i> means a weak character (paragraph 6), so this option would create a tautology (a poor character can be blamed on weak, or poor, character).
