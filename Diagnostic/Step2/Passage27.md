# Passage 27
We are now witnessing the death of management. By management, I mean the peculiarly American idea (still taught at many business schools) that a “good manager” should be able to manage any enterprise, anywhere, any time. Through incisive analysis and decisive action, our supermanagers supposedly could make any company productive and profitable. That idea has collapsed with failures at companies that once symbolized the U.S. management prowess: Sears, Westinghouse, and IBM.

With hindsight, we can see the absurdity. We don’t imagine a winning football coach switching to basketball, nor a concert pianist becoming a symphony violinist. We don’t think an orthopedic surgeon would automatically make a good psychiatrist. We recognize that differences in talent, temperament, knowledge, and experience make some people good at some things and not at others. Somehow, managers were supposed to be immune to this logic.

They aren’t, of course. Indeed, the people who have created great businesses in recent decades typically confirm the logic. They have not been all-purpose executives, casually changing jobs and succeeding on the strength of dazzling analysis. Instead, they have been semi-fanatics who doggedly pursued a few good ideas. People like Sam Walton (Wal-Mart), Ray Kroc (McDonald’s), William McGowan (MCI), and Bill Gates (Microsoft).

What seems astonishing is how such a bad idea survived so long. Our infatuation with it partly reflected Americans’ optimism that all problems are amenable to reason. In 1914, Frederick Winslow Taylor’s _The Principles of Scientific Management_ appeared and set the tone. Taylor pioneered time-and-motion studies, which analyzed how specific jobs might be done more efficiently. But his larger purpose was to “prove that the best management is a true science, resting upon clearly defined laws.”

Up to a point, who can quarrel with a resort to reason? The trouble is that it was taken too far and became self-destructive. The problem was not that freelance managers constantly jumped between companies, although that happened. The problem was that the style of running big companies changed for the worse. The belief that all problems could be solved by analysis favored the rise of executives who were adept with numbers and with making slick presentations. Huge staffs of analysts served these executives. Conglomerates multiplied on the theory that a good manager could manage anything.

With bigger bureaucracies, companies couldn’t respond quickly to market changes, new technology, competitors, or customer needs. The more powerful top executives became, the less they knew. Their information was filtered through staff reports and statistical tables. Some executives developed what consultant Mel Stuckey calls a phobia of manufacturing: they didn’t know what happened in factories and feared exposing their ignorance.

Roger Smith, GM’s chairperson between 1981 and 1990, exemplified this sort of know-nothing executive. When asked by _Fortune_ magazine to explain what went wrong, he answered: “I don’t know. It’s a mysterious thing.” To fathom what had gone wrong, Smith would truly have had to understand the way automobiles are designed and made; he apparently never did, despite a career at GM. As a society, we have spent more than a decade paying for mistakes like Smith’s. Inept management, though not the only cause of corporate turmoil, has been a major contributor. “Downsizing” and “restructuring” are but the catchwords for the harsh process by which companies are seeking to regain their edge.

  <summary>Question 157</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: restricted the book to analyses of efficiency.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply passage arguments to make a prediction about a scenario not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: been a manager, rather than a scientist.
<br>
Incorrect. Given the author’s general disdain for management rather than practice or specific knowledge, it seems unlikely he would have preferred Taylor to be a manager than a scientist.
<br><br>
Option B: been more specific in defining his management principles.
<br>
Incorrect. This is contradicted by the author’s critical statement: “The belief that all problems could be solved by analysis favored the rise of executives who were adept with numbers and with making slick presentations” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: restricted his work to analyses of efficiency.
<br>
Correct. Much of the passage is a critique of the increasing attention to “management” rather than attention to what businesses actually do. The author writes: “In 1914, Frederick Winslow Taylor’s <i>The Principles of Scientific Management</i> appeared and set the tone. Taylor pioneered time-and-motion studies, which analyzed how specific jobs might be done more efficiently. But his larger purpose was to ‘prove that the best management is a true science, resting upon clearly defined laws’” (paragraph 4). Based on the author’s broader discussion, it seems clear he would have preferred that Taylor keep his focus on time and motion studies.
<br><br>
Option D: based his work on the observations of managers, rather than on a theory of management.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this in the passage.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 158</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: really did not know what went wrong.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to use passage context and language to make an inference based on the author’s explicit statements.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: probably suspected what went wrong but was not confident enough to voice his suspicions.
<br>
Incorrect. The author makes no reference to, nor implies, any lack of confidence on Smith’s part.
<br><br>
Option B: must have known what went wrong but was refusing to say so.
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s statement suggests the belief that Smith really did not know what had gone wrong: "To fathom what had gone wrong, Smith would truly have had to understand the way automobiles are designed and made; he apparently never did…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: must have misunderstood the question that had been posed.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says nothing that would point to Smith’s misunderstanding.
<br><br>
Option D: really did not know what went wrong.
<br>
Correct. The author’s statement: "To fathom what had gone wrong, Smith would truly have had to understand the way automobiles are designed and made; he apparently never did…" (final paragraph) supports this option.

  <summary>Question 159</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Acquire as much knowledge of management practices as possible.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider a scenario not discussed in the passage and apply the author’s argument to the scenario. Note that this question has a negative stem and asks you to identify the option most <i>opposed</i> to the one that the author would endorse.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Learn as much about a particular industry as possible.
<br>
Incorrect. The author believes in specialization; the author writes: “We don’t imagine a winning football coach switching to basketball, nor a concert pianist becoming a symphony violinist....We recognize that differences in talent, temperament, knowledge, and experience make some people good at some things and not at others” (paragraph 2). In terms of business, specifically, the author writes: “people who have created great businesses in recent decades…have not been all-purpose executives, casually changing jobs and succeeding on the strength of dazzling analysis. Instead, they have been semi-fanatics who doggedly pursued a few good ideas” (paragraph 3). This option would be one the author agrees with, not one the author opposes.
<br><br>
Option B: Acquire as much knowledge of management practices as possible.
<br>
Correct. The first paragraph, along with paragraphs 2, 5, and 6 all say that to succeed in business, one does not need “all-purpose” management practices, so the author would <i>not</i> endorse the acquisition of "as much knowledge of management practices as possible,"
<br><br>
Option C: Advance to the presidency of a small corporation.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says: "With bigger bureaucracies, companies couldn't respond quickly to market changes…" (paragraph 6), suggesting that small corporations have more success, so this would not oppose the author's vision.
<br><br>
Option D: Work as efficiently as possible on each management task.
<br>
Incorrect. This is neither aligned with nor opposed to the author's vision of appropriate management; efficiency is not the issue the author emphasizes.

  <summary>Question 160</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Smith’s inability to succeed in that particular industry, or to his overreliance on general management skills.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question that asks you to integrate information about the overall passage argument with a specific textual reference in order to identify what the author most likely intends to indicate with the reference.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Smith’s inability to succeed in that particular industry, or to his overreliance on general management skills.
<br>
Correct. The passage as a whole is a critique of what the author sees as excessive faith in the field of “management” in general and a corresponding lack of attention to knowledge of the operations of specific industries. The author makes this point throughout the passage, including in the opening paragraph: “We are now witnessing the death of management. By management, I mean the peculiarly American idea (still taught at many business schools) that a “good manager” should be able to manage any enterprise, anywhere, anytime.” In the final paragraph, the author suggests that Smith, as part of this trend, did not sufficiently understand the automobile industry: “To fathom what had gone wrong, Smith would truly have had to understand the way automobiles are designed and made; he apparently never did, despite a career at GM. As a society, we have spent more than a decade paying for mistakes like Smith’s.”
<br><br>
Option B: Smith’s overreliance on a large staff, or to his overreliance on his own judgments.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: Smith’s poor judgment in a few critical cases, or to his poor judgment in most cases.
<br>
Incorrect. There is potential support for the idea that Smith may have shown "poor judgment" in his role at GM due to lack of knowledge (final paragraph), but no support for this option’s reference to the idea that Smith’s “poor judgment” was displayed "in a few critical cases" or "in most cases".
<br><br>
Option D: Smith’s limited experience as a manager, or to his insensitivity to consumers’ needs.
<br>
Incorrect. Given that the passage tells us that Smith was chairperson for nine years (final paragraph), it is unlikely that he had "limited experience as a manager"; further the passage critiques an overemphasis on the discipline of management, so it is unlikely the author would attribute Smith’s “mistakes” to limited managerial experience. The passage does not support this option’s reference to "insensitivity" to consumers' needs.

<details>
  <summary>Question 161</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: Learn as much as possible about the successes and failures of other producers of calculators

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the insights of the passage to a new situation, one not discussed or alluded to in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Consult with other entrepreneurs who have been successful in their own fields
<br>
Incorrect. This is in line with the theory of a kind of “one-size-fits-all” approach to management, which is exactly what the author argues against.
<br><br>
Option B: Increase efficiency by making the calculators as similar to the wristwatches as possible
<br>
Incorrect. The author argues that it is a mistake to overlook the specialized knowledge necessary to succeed in a specific field or industry (paragraph 2). This option suggests trying to make one industry mirror another without attaining sufficient specialized knowledge in the new industry, which is not consistent with the passage argument.
<br><br>
Option C: Hire technical experts to advise management about the progress of the venture
<br>
Incorrect. Insofar as the mentioned technical experts know about calculators, this aligns with the passage argument, but their advice should be <i>about calculators</i>, not about "the progress of the venture."
<br><br>
Option D: Learn as much as possible about the successes and failures of other producers of calculators
<br>
Correct. This product-specific approach is clearly advocated at the end of paragraph 6 and in the final paragraph.

  <summary>Question 162</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: come to know less about how to provide medical care.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a hypothetical scenario not discussed in the passage (as an analogy to passage arguments) then asks you to apply the passage argument to this hypothetical scenario.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: be perceived as less responsible for patients’ welfare.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for "less responsible."
<br><br>
Option B: come to know less about how to provide medical care.
<br>
Correct. The author says that in bigger bureaucracies, "the more powerful top executives became, the less they knew. Their information was filtered through staff reports…" (paragraph 6). The analogy here clearly suggests that the physician who had a large staff for his or her private practice would come to know less about the primary business of the practice—providing medical care.
<br><br>
Option C: become more concerned with treating disease and less concerned with preventing it.
<br>
Incorrect. There is simply no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option D: overlook important administrative duties.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for the claim that a larger staff would be inclined to de-emphasize “important administrative duties.”

<details>
  <summary>Question 163</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: superficial understanding.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that asks you to examine the context of an author’s use of a particular term to make an inference about what the author intends by the term.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: superficial understanding.
<br>
Correct. The author describes “analysis” as something that those who over-valued the task of “management” believed could conquer any problem: “Through incisive analysis and decisive action, our supermanagers supposedly could make any company productive and profitable. That idea has collapsed with failures at companies… “(first paragraph). Later in the passage, the author writes: “The belief that all problems could be solved by analysis favored the rise of executives who were adept with numbers and with making slick presentations” (paragraph 5) The author’s use of “slick” to qualify “analysis” clearly suggests that this analysis may have <i>looked</i> good to managers, but failed to deliver on its promise:
<br><br>
Option B: substantive understanding.
<br>
Incorrect. To the contrary, the author’s reference to “slick analysis” in paragraph 5 connotes superficial, rather than substantive, knowledge.
<br><br>
Option C: a desire for improvement.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option D: a sense of competitiveness.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no discussion of competition in the passage in the context of the author’s references to “analysis.”

  <summary>Question 164</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: the all-purpose manager is a uniquely American concept.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the degree of supporting evidence for particular passage claims.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: some companies have already experienced the “death of management.”
<br>
Incorrect. Support for this claim is provided in the first paragraph with the examples of Sears, Westinghouse, and IBM.
<br><br>
Option B: society pays for the mistakes associated with poor management.
<br>
Incorrect. Support for this claim is provided in the final paragraph: "As a society, we have spent more than a decade paying for mistakes.…'Downsizing' and 'restructuring' are but the catchwords for the harsh process by which companies are seeking to regain their edge."
<br><br>
Option C: the all-purpose manager is a uniquely American concept.
<br>
Correct. No support is given for this claim (made in the first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: Taylor thought that the notion of an all-purpose manager was valid.
<br>
Incorrect. The author provides evidence (with a direct quotation from Taylor’s work) that Taylor was concerned not only with optimizing the performance of “specific jobs,” but with the overarching “science’ of management more broadly: “In 1914, Frederick Winslow Taylor’s <i>The Principles of Scientific Management</i> appeared and set the tone. Taylor pioneered time-and-motion studies, which analyzed how specific jobs might be done more efficiently. But his larger purpose was to “prove that the best management is a true science, resting upon clearly defined laws’” (paragraph 4).
