# Passage 24
Early in 1968 the state’s newspapers were taking note of the discovery, in one of the rock houses in the Gorge, of a crude hut built of short split planks. One of its planks bore the carved name: “D. boon.” There was some controversy over whether or not it really was built by Daniel Boone. But the news of the discovery and of the controversy over it had given the place a certain fame.

The find interested me, for I never cease to regret the scarcity of knowledge of the first explorations of the continent. Some hint, such as the “Boone hut” might provide, of the experience of the long hunters would be invaluable. And so one of my earliest visits to the Gorge included a trip to see the hut.

Once I found the path leading down through the woods, it was clear to me that I had already had numerous predecessors. And I had not gone far before I knew their species: Scattered more and more thickly along the trail the nearer I got to the site of the hut was the trash that has come to be more characteristic than shoe prints of the race that produced such a man as D. boon. When I came to the rock house itself, I found the mouth of it entirely closed by a chain-link fence. Outside the fence, the ground was littered with Polaroid negatives, film spools, film boxes, food wrappers, cigarette butts, a paper plate.

And inside the fence, which I peered through like a prisoner, was the hut, a forlorn relic overpowered by what had been done to protect it from collectors of mementos, who would perhaps not even know what it was supposed to remind them of. There it was, perhaps a vital clue to our history and our inheritance, turned into a curio. Whether because of the ignorant enthusiasm of souvenir hunters or because of the strenuous measures necessary to protect it from them, Boone’s hut had become a doodad.

I did not go back to that place again, not wanting to be associated with the crowd whose vandalism had been so accurately foreseen and so overwhelmingly thwarted. But I did not forget it either, and the memory of it seems to me to bear, both for the Gorge and for ourselves, a heavy premonition of ruin. I have a vision of a time when our children will go to the Gorge and find there a webwork of paved, heavily littered trails passing through tunnels of steel mesh. When people are so ignorant and destructive that they must be divided by a fence from what is vital to them, whether it is their history or their world, they are imprisoned.

I consider the ironic possibility that what I will write for love of the Gorge may also contribute to its destruction, enlarging the hearsay of it, bringing in more people to drive the roads and crowd the “points of interest” until they become exactly as interesting as a busy street. And yet I might as well leave the place anonymous, for what I have learned here could be learned from any woods and any free-running river.

Since I was here last, the leaves have fallen. The forest has been at work, dying to renew itself, covering the tracks of those of us who were here. It is showing us what to hope for. What humans know and presume about the earth is part of it, passing always back into it, carried on by it into what they do not know.

  <summary>Question 137</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: The equipment left on glaciers by mountain climbers

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to extrapolate from passage information to assess which new scenario is most analogous to a situation described in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The collapsing houses in abandoned frontier towns
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not describe the hut as part of a group of huts, or as on a site that is similar to an abandoned town or city.
<br><br>
Option B: The graffiti on the walls of subway tunnels
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing “creative” or artistic in the description of the site where the hut was found (as there is in graffiti found in subway tunnels).
<br><br>
Option C: The equipment left on glaciers by mountain climbers
<br>
Correct. The author describes the site of the hut as littered with all kinds of garbage: "Scattered more and more thickly along the trail the nearer I got to the site of the hut was…the trash…. [T]he ground was littered with Polaroid negatives, film spools, film boxes, food wrappers, cigarette butts, a paper plate” (paragraph 3). This option also describes refuse left behind by people heedless of their effect on the site.
<br><br>
Option D: The pottery shards found in prehistoric rubbish pits
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes the “rubbish” as historic, but the rubbish described in the passage is contemporary, while it is the hut which is a historic site.

  <summary>Question 138</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: overcrowded with tourists.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to infer the consequences or implications of the author’s meaning based on passage context.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: overcrowded with tourists.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: “I consider the ironic possibility that what I will write for love of the Gorge may also contribute to its destruction, enlarging the hearsay of it, bringing in more people to drive the roads and crowd the “points of interest” until they become exactly as interesting as a busy street” (paragraph 6). The author is clearly concerned about bringing too much attention to the Gorge, drawing visitors to what has now become an attraction—or, in other words, encouraging tourists to overrun the site.
<br><br>
Option B: more interesting than a crude hut.
<br>
Incorrect. The author clearly recognizes and appreciates the potential historical value of the hut (paragraphs 2 and 4, for instance); its “crude[ness]” is not what the author objects to about the condition of the hut.
<br><br>
Option C: a monument to technological advances.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this reference to technology; moreover, the author’s reference to the site becoming “as interesting as a busy street” is clearly a negative one, given the context of the fear that the author’s own writing may contribute to the destruction of the site.
<br><br>
Option D: less cluttered with rubbish.
<br>
Incorrect. If anything, given that the author suggests that the site’s notoriety may bring an influx of tourists, and given the passage description of rubbish left behind by visitors, one could infer that the site would be likely to attract <i>more</i> rubbish.

  <summary>Question 139</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: That isolation from nature and history diminishes people

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, because it asks you to use passage context to make an inference about the implications or meaning of the author’s use of a word or image.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: That the Gorge has lost the freedom of its natural state
<br>
Incorrect. Although the hut is described as a “forlorn relic,” separated from its viewers, who would not know how to approach it respectfully, the image of a “prisoner” is linked to the author and to the “ignorant” people kept from the hut, not primarily to the hut itself.
<br><br>
Option B: That the earth is imprisoned by pavement and rubbish
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author does lament the presence of trash on the site, this is not what the image of the prisoner is used to convey.
<br><br>
Option C: That national treasures are being held captive behind fences
<br>
Incorrect. The author does position the hut as a “forlorn relic overpowered by what had been done to protect it from collectors of mementos, who would perhaps not even know what it was supposed to remind them of" (paragraph 4). But the author explicitly describes himself or herself as a prisoner, and also uses the image of imprisonment to describe the people kept from the site; the image is not used primarily to describe the condition of the hut.
<br><br>
Option D : That isolation from nature and history diminishes people
<br>
  Correct. “And inside the fence, which I peered through <i>like a prisoner</i>, was the hut, a forlorn relic overpowered by what had been done to protect it from collectors of mementos, who would perhaps not even know what it was supposed to remind them of. There it was, perhaps a vital clue to our history and our inheritance, turned into a curio” (paragraph 4). The author and other potential visitors are separated from the site of their collective history. The author’s second reference to a prisoner is more explicit: “When people are so ignorant and destructive that they must be divided by a fence from what is vital to them, whether it is their history or their world, <i>they are imprisoned</i>” (paragraph 5). Again, the author decries the separation of people from their own history and their own natural environment.

  <summary>Question 140</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Because the story of the hut referred to more general processes, the author would be unaffected.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it raises a new and hypothetical circumstance, one not discussed in the passage, and asks you to use passage information to predict the author’s response to this new circumstance.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Because the story of the hut referred to more general processes, the author would be unaffected.
<br>
Correct. The author is certainly interested in the “invaluable” historical information the hut could provide (paragraph 2), but ultimately the author makes broader points about the value of history and of the natural world: “When people are so ignorant and destructive that they must be divided by a fence from what is vital to them, whether it is their history or their world, they are imprisoned. (paragraph 5). Even more salient to arriving at the answer is this point: “And yet I might as well leave the place anonymous, for what I have learned here could be learned from any woods and any free-running river” (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option B: Because the Gorge would no longer be a tourist attraction, the author would be pleased.
<br>
Incorrect. The author might feel some relief that the Gorge would be less trampled or littered by tourists, but the site itself is less important to the author than the larger concerns he or she expresses: “And yet I might as well leave the place anonymous, for what I have learned here could be learned from any woods and any free-running river” (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option C: Because the hut could provide no clues to the experience of the long hunters, the author would be disappointed.
<br>
Incorrect. The author was indeed interested in the knowledge the hut might provide, but more importantly says that “what I have learned here could be learned from any woods and any free-running river” (paragraph 6). So, the author’s primary response to the situation described in the stem would be unlikely to be disappointment.
<br><br>
Option D: Because the damage to the site resulted from a mistake, the author would be annoyed.
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s larger concern is not the damage to the hut, but the separation of people from their history and the natural world, so this option is far too narrow to encompass the author’s likely response.

  <summary>Question 141</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Disdainful

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to determine the author’s attitude or assumptions about the passage topic. The question requires you to recognize the language within the cited paragraph that indicates authorial opinion or bias.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A:
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s language and tone suggest that he or she treats the deterioration of the hut as a serious loss—almost a desecration. The author describes the hut as having offered “perhaps a vital clue to our history and inheritance, turned into a curio” (paragraph 4). There is no suggestion that the author treats it in a gentle, bemused manner, as this option would have it.
<br><br>
Option B:
<br>
Correct. The author refers to the visitors to the hut as propelled by “ignorant enthusiasm” and as likely at least partially responsible for making the hut “into a curio” and a “doodad” (paragraph 4). The author has just called the hut “perhaps a vital clue to our history and inheritance,” so the dismissive, patronizing language used for what the hut has become strongly suggests disdain for the people who have been at least to some degree responsible for the current condition of the hut.
<br><br>
Option C:
<br>
Incorrect. The author treats the visitors to the hut as at least partially responsible for its deteriorating condition and implicitly chastises them for their “ignoran[ce]”; there is no indication in this paragraph that the author is “tolerant” of the visitors to the hut.
<br><br>
Option D:
<br>
Incorrect. The author uses strong language in the paragraph, describing the hut—a “vital clue to our history and inheritance”—as now a “forlorn relic.” The author’s feelings about the potential value of the hut and its deterioration into a “relic,” a “doodad,” and a “curio,” suggest passion, rather than apathy, toward the topic.
