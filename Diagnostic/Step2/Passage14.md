# Passage 14
The historian distinguishes between the _outside_ and the _inside_ of an event. By the outside of an event, I mean everything about it that can be described in terms of persons and their movements: the passage of Caesar, accompanied by certain men, across a river called the Rubicon, or the spilling of his blood on the floor of the Senate. By the _inside_ of an event, I mean the aspects of it that can be described only in terms of thought: Caesar's decision to invade Gaul in defiance of Republican law, or the clash of constitutional policy between him and his assassins.

Historians are never exclusively concerned with the outside or the inside of events. They are interested in the crossing of the Rubicon only in relation to Republican law and in the spilling of Caesar's blood in the Senate only in relation to a constitutional conflict. Their work may concern the discovery of the outside of an event, but their main task is to understand this action by discerning the thought of its agent.

In the case of nature, this distinction does not arise. The events of nature are simply events, not the acts of agents whose thought an investigator endeavors to trace. It is true that scientists, like historians, must go beyond the discovery of events, but the direction in which they move is very different. The scientist attempts to explain an unfamiliar event in terms of a general formula or theory. To a scientist, nature consists always and only of "phenomena," not in the sense of lacking meaning but in the sense of presenting a spectacle for intelligent observation.

In contrast, the events of history are never just spectacles for contemplation; they are phenomena that the historian looks not at, but through, to discern the thought within them. In penetrating to the inside of events, the historian does something that the scientist need not and cannot do. In this respect, the task of the historian is more complex than that of the scientist. In another way, it is simpler: The historian need not and cannot emulate science in searching for the causes or laws of events. For science, the event is discovered by perceiving it, and further research is for its cause. When the cause has been determined, the event is assigned to its class and the relation between that class and others has been clarified.

Since for history, the object to be discovered is not the event itself but the thought it expresses, to discover the thought is to understand the event. Once the facts have been ascertained, there is no need for further investigation. When historians know what happened, they know why it happened. This distinction does not mean that the concepts _cause_ and _effect_ are inappropriate in reference to history; it means that they are used there in a special sense.

When scientists ask "Why did that piece of litmus paper turn pink?" they mean "On what kinds of occasion do all pieces of litmus paper turn pink? What are the invariable antecedent conditions?" When historians ask "Why did Brutus stab Caesar?" they do not mean "what historical conditions led to this event?" but "What did Brutus think that made him decide to stab Caesar?" The reason for this thought relates it to other events, with their own internal motives. The cause of an event, for historians, is not something apart from it but its inner aspect.

  <summary>Question 77</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: Historians are not content to describe human actions.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to look at the claims made by the passage author to see which inferences you can draw from these claims.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Historians have a clearer goal than do scientists.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option. Although the passage compares historians with scientists, the comparison does not address the respective clarity of their goals.
<br><br>
Option B: Scientists have an easier task than do historians.
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s claims do not point in so straightforward a direction. Rather, the author suggests that this claim is both true and not true: "In this respect, the task of the historian is more complex than that of the scientist. In another way, it is simpler…" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: Historians are not content to describe human actions.
<br>
Correct. This option is supported by the following quotation: "… the events of history are never just spectacles for contemplation; they are phenomena that the historian looks not at, but through, to <i>discern the thought within</i> them" (paragraph 4)
<br><br>
Option D: Scientists are not concerned with the inside of events.
<br>
  Incorrect. It is not that the author suggests that scientists are not <i>concerned with</i> the “inside” of events, but that the specific framing of an event in terms of “inside” and “outside” is not relevant to scientists: In the case of nature, this distinction does not arise.…It is true that scientists, like historians, must go beyond the discovery of events, but the direction in which they move is very different. The scientist attempts to explain an unfamiliar event in terms of a general formula or theory” (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 78</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: felt bound to obey the law of the Republic.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which presents a hypothetical scenario not presented in the passage and asks you how this scenario would affect passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: felt bound to obey the law of the Republic.
<br>
  Correct. The passage says that “By the <i>inside</i> of an event, I mean the aspects of it that can be described only in terms of thought: Caesar's decision to invade Gaul in defiance of Republican law” (first paragraph), and then goes on to say: “Historians are never exclusively concerned with the outside or the inside of events. They are interested in the crossing of the Rubicon only in relation to Republican law” (paragraph 2). If, then, historians discovered that Caesar did not cross the Rubicon, they would also be likely to make a conclusion about Caesar’s thought process: that he wanted to adhere to Republican law.
<br><br>
Option B: was not a brave or enterprising general.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage because the author does not say it was brave or enterprising for Caesar <i>to</i> have crossed the Rubicon.
<br><br>
Option C: considered the river too dangerous for the attempt.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: understood that doing so would cause a constitutional crisis.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not connect crossing the Rubicon with the constitutional crisis; it is the “spilling of Caesar’s blood in the Senate” that the author links to the constitutional crisis.

  <summary>Question 79</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: does not address the sort of question that concerns scientists.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it introduces information that is not discussed in the passage and asks you to consider how this information would affect the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: does not address the sort of question that concerns scientists.
<br>
Correct. The author clearly distinguishes between the kinds of causes that interest historians (the “thought” that proceeds or motivates an event) and the kinds of causes that interest scientists: “The scientist attempts to explain an unfamiliar event in terms of a general formula or theory”.(paragraph 3). Because the scenario discussed in the stem is about motivation and thought, it is not the kind of question that would be of interest to scientists, as their research interests are defined in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: disregards the distinction between the outside and the inside of events.
<br>
Incorrect. Given the final paragraph, the mentioned research does the opposite: it attends to the distinction between the outside (the event of helping strangers) and the inside of events (the helpers' motivation).
<br><br>
Option C: exemplifies the scientific approach to the investigation of a phenomenon.
<br>
  Incorrect. Given the final paragraph, investigating motivation does <i>not</i> exemplify the scientific approach to the investigation of a phenomenon. Determining cause (paragraph 4) and asking “'What are the invariable antecedent conditions?'” (final paragraph) exemplifies the scientific approach.
<br><br>
Option D: shows an understanding of cause that differs from that of historians.
<br>
  Incorrect. The described social psychologists show an understanding of cause that is <i>similar</i> to that of historians—they show a concern with "internal motives" (final paragraph).

  <summary>Question 80</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: II and III only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which begins with a statement from the passage and tests your understanding of the author’s intended meaning in this statement. This question requires you to recognize paraphrases and implications of the author’s words.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: I only
<br>
Incorrect. The author writes: "When historians ask 'Why did Brutus stab Caesar?' they [mean]…'What did Brutus think that made him decide to stab Caesar?' The reason for this thought relates it to other events with their own internal motives…" (final paragraph). This statement implies that historians <i>do</i> try to discover reasons for events. Thus, I is incorrect.
<br><br>
Option B: III only
<br>
Incorrect. III is correct, but so is II.
<br><br>
Option C: I and II only
<br>
Incorrect. Although II is correct, I is incorrect.
<br><br>
Option D: II and III only
<br>
Correct. "When historians ask 'Why did Brutus stab Caesar?' they [mean]…'What did Brutus think that made him decide to stab Caesar?' The reason for this thought relates it to other events with their own internal motives…. The cause of an event, for historians, is…its inner aspect" (final paragraph). This statement implies that for historians, understanding an event includes understanding the intention behind it, so II is correct. III is also correct. The author writes: “When historians know what happened, they know why it happened. This distinction does not mean that the concepts <i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i> are inappropriate in reference to history; it means that they are used there in a special sense” (paragraph 5). The author goes on to say, “The cause of an event, for historians, is not something apart from it but its inner aspect” (final paragraph). The idea of a “cause and effect <i>chain</i> of events,” in III, describes a discrete cause producing a discrete event, in a sequential fashion. It does not describe the cause as an “inner” function of the event, as the author describes. Thus, III is correct.

  <summary>Question 81</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: human actions are not predictable with the certainty of natural phenomena.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply passage information to make a claim that is not included in or encompassed by the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: human actions are not predictable with the certainty of natural phenomena.
<br>
Correct. The author describes scientific theories as predicting outcomes that always hold: “When scientists ask ‘Why did that piece of litmus paper turn pink?’ they mean ‘On what kinds of occasion do all pieces of litmus paper turn pink? What are the invariable antecedent conditions?’” (final paragraph). By contrast, the author describes historians as searching for the thought that was internal to an event: “When historians ask ‘Why did Brutus stab Caesar?’…[they] mean ‘What did Brutus think that made him decide to stab Caesar?’ The reason for this thought relates it to other events, with their own internal motives” (final paragraph). Of course, human thought is not predictable and regular in the way that scientific laws are, in the author’s telling.
<br><br>
Option B: historians have not yet determined the principles on which history is based.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not make this claim and describes the thought pattern and priorities of historians throughout the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: theories summarize research results, and historians do not perform research.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: historians are concerned only with the past, and theories describe the present.
<br>
Incorrect. The author never links theories with the past versus the present.
