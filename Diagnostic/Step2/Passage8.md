# Passage 8
Not only are the rich getting relatively richer, but there are relatively fewer Americans clustered in the middle of the income distribution. Some studies show that more people left the middle because they joined the affluent than because their incomes went down. Some studies show that more Americans went down than up.

For decades after World War II, guidance counselors told high-schoolers that without a college education they’d be sunk, and for decades the guidance counselors were wrong. In the sixties and early seventies, the economic advantage of a college degree actually diminished. In 1973, 30-year-old men with four years of college made, on average, just 15 percent more than 30-year-old men who only had high school degrees. But then the advantage of the college educated grew rapidly until, by 1986, the gap in earnings had widened to 49 percent. The world the guidance counselors warned us about has finally arrived. The ability of the skilled and educated to make relatively more money is one major source of inequality.

A second oft-cited source is demographic: the flood of “baby boomers” into the labor market. The advent of the boomers produced a natural bulge at the lower end of the wage scale. Worse, as these boomers competed with each other for entry-level work, they bid down entry-level wages—a phenomenon called “crowding.” Between 1973 and 1987, the real (adjusted for inflation) incomes of full-time younger workers fell, while the incomes of older workers rose. Unskilled younger workers took an especially big hit.

The demographic explanation is supposed to be reassuring, on the theory that income differences caused by the baby boom will cure themselves over time. The only problem is that it isn’t happening. Boomers started hitting their mid-thirties in 1980.

Several other factors are probably contributing to the growing inequality. One is the trend toward two incomes. Most families (about 60 percent) now get by on two incomes. Those stuck with only one are going to do relatively worse. To some extent, the new great divide is between the life one income can buy and the life two incomes can buy.

Another factor is the ominous trend toward _assortative mating_, marrying someone in your own income class. Take two single people, one a lawyer making $60,000 and the other a clerk making $20,000. If they choose their mates at random, it probably won’t increase the gap between their two double-earner families. But what if the $60,000 lawyer marries another $60,000 lawyer, and the $20,000 clerk marries a $20,000 clerk? Then the difference in their incomes suddenly becomes the difference between $120,000 and $40,000—and the $120,000 couple really leaves a $20,000 single-earner family in the dust. Although the trend is still masked in the income statistics by the low average wages of women, it’s obvious that something like this is in fact happening.

Finally, there are trends that might affect the distribution of _wealth_. If you bought your house before, say, 1973, you paid a nice, low fixed mortgage and benefited from the average 121 percent increase in the value of the average home between 1973 and 1980. But someone who waited until 1981 got socked with high mortgage rates and missed the boat on appreciation. Two people might have identical incomes, but because of the timing of their home purchases they would wind up with very unequal wealth.

  <summary>Question 43</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: an infusion of young workers into the job market.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to use passage information to make a prediction about the effect on the economy of new scenarios not explicitly addressed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: an increase in the number of high-wage assembly-line jobs.
<br>
  Incorrect. This would not <i>worsen</i> economic inequality. The author explains that “The ability of the skilled and educated to make relatively more money is one major source of inequality” (paragraph 2). This option describes a circumstance in which less educated workers could earn more money in factory jobs, so this option would <i>reduce</i> economic inequality.
<br><br>
Option B: an infusion of young workers into the job market.
<br>
Correct. An infusion of young workers into the job market would result in what the passage describes as “crowding”: "Worse, as these boomers competed with each other for entry-level work, they bid down entry-level wages—a phenomenon called 'crowding'. Between 1973 and 1987, the real (adjusted for inflation) incomes of full-time younger workers fell, while the incomes of older workers rose" (paragraph 3). As the passage indicates, the result would increase economic inequality.
<br><br>
Option C: tuition credits making college education accessible to all.
<br>
Incorrect. This would likely increase the number of those who have college educations, including among people who previously might not have been able to afford to pay for college. Because according to the passage, education increasingly determines the ability to earn more money (paragraph 2), this option would reduce, rather than exacerbate, income inequality.
<br><br>
Option D: a tax on investment earnings to fund job training for displaced workers.
<br>
Incorrect. This would reduce inequality because it would use money from those at the higher end of the income distribution to help those who are struggling to earn money (displaced workers) become trained to make more money with increased training.

  <summary>Question 44</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: moved out of their low-earning years.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it requires you to look at a term or concept that the author explains in the passage, to see what is (and is not, in this case) included in that explanation.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: graduated from college.
<br>
Incorrect. The demographic explanation does account for the increasing presence of younger Boomers in the labor market: "as these boomers competed with each other for entry-level work, they bid down entry-level wages—a phenomenon called 'crowding'. Between 1973 and 1987, the real (adjusted for inflation) incomes of full-time younger workers fell, while the incomes of older workers rose" (paragraph 3). The author implies that Boomers without college educations would be <i>particularly</i> disadvantaged in this period: “Unskilled younger workers took an especially big hit” (paragraph 3). The discussion of an increase in younger workers in the labor market and its negative effect on wages between 1973 and 1986, however, also encompasses younger workers (entry-level workers) who have gone to college.
<br><br>
Option B: married and combined incomes.
<br>
Incorrect. The demographic explanation accounts for an increase in inequality after the boomers married and combined incomes: “Several other factors are probably contributing to the growing inequality. One is the trend toward two incomes. Most families (about 60 percent) now get by on two incomes” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: moved out of their low-earning years.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "The demographic explanation is supposed to be reassuring, on the theory that income differences caused by the baby boom will cure themselves over time. The only problem is that it isn't happening. Boomers started hitting their mid-thirties in 1980" (paragraph 4), at which time they moved out of their low-earning years—the inequalities should have, therefore, started disappearing, but they have not (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: surpassed their parents’ generation in purchases of consumer goods.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not addressed in the passage; furthermore, purchases of consumer goods are irrelevant to inequality as inequality in the passage concerns earning potential, not how much people buy. (The final paragraph does describe the differences in wealth that are influenced by whether and when one buys a home and thus accrues wealth, but consumer goods are not part of this analysis).

  <summary>Question 46</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: The elimination of gender discrimination would magnify income inequality among assortatively mated heterosexual couples.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning within the Text question because it asks you to consider the logical implications or consequences of the author’s argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The elimination of gender discrimination would magnify income inequality among assortatively mated couples.
<br>
Correct. The passage defines assortative mating as “marrying someone in your own income class” (paragraph 6), presumably with a similar level of education. Without gender discrimination, which the passage indicates lowers “the average wages of women” (paragraph 6), the combined income of an assortatively mated, heterosexual, high-earning couple would be higher than it would be if the income of the high-earning woman was artificially depressed by gender discrimination.
<br><br>
Option B: As women’s average wages rise, the earnings advantage of assortatively mated couples over randomly mated ones will grow.
<br>
Incorrect. We cannot know that this happens with randomly mated couples; it would depend on who mates with who. The assortatively mated couple could both be lower earners and be earning $20,000 plus $20,000 (instead of $20,000 plus $15,000, with gender discrimination), but the randomly mated couple could be one lower earner and one higher earner and be earning $20,000 plus $60,000 (instead of $20,000 plus $40,000, with discrimination. This would not show an earnings advantage for the assortatively mated over the randomly mated couple.
<br><br>
Option C: Randomly mated couples suffer disproportionately from the low average wages of women.
<br>
Incorrect. This would not necessarily happen; it would depend on who mates with who. The randomly mated couples would disproportionately suffer only if they were disproportionately populated with women and lower-earning people.
<br><br>
Option D: Gender discrimination has contributed to income inequality among two-income couples.
<br>
Incorrect. The example given in the passage is of a higher-income lawyer and a lower-income clerk, but there could be as many female lawyers as female clerks; that is, gender discrimination occurs for both high-income and low-income earners, so it hasn't necessarily contributed to inequality among two-income heterosexual couples.

  <summary>Question 47</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: The shrinking of the real incomes of young workers during the 1970s and 1980s

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents information that is not included in the passage and asks you which option contains evidence that would provide the strongest support for that new information. In asking you which evidence most strongly supports the claim in the stem, the question also gives you practice in skills that are tested in Reasoning Within the Text questions.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The earnings disadvantage suffered by non-college-educated 30-year-old males in 1973

Incorrect. Paragraph 2 describes a relatively small earning disadvantage for non-college-educated males in 1973, certainly smaller than in later years. Further, any earnings disadvantage for those <i>without</i> a college degree would <i>weaken</i>, rather than support, the claim in the stem that schools were failing to prepare students for available jobs.

Option B: The earnings advantage enjoyed by college-educated 30-year-old males in 1986

Incorrect. Since the earnings advantage enjoyed by college-educated 30-year-old males in 1986 over those without a college degree was substantial (49 percent, according to paragraph 2), this suggests that the American education system <i>has</i> adapted to prepare students for the right kind of jobs—jobs that still exist, in other words.

Option C: The shrinking of the middle class relative to the lower class during the 1970s and 1980s

Incorrect. This option is not clearly connected to the education system at all.

Option D: The shrinking of the real incomes of young workers during the 1970s and 1980s

Correct. In the passage discussion of inequality, the author writes: "Between 1973 and 1987, the real (adjusted for inflation) incomes of full-time younger workers fell, while the incomes of older workers rose" (paragraph 3). If younger workers were doing relatively poorly in the labor market when compared to older workers, this certainly provides potential support for the argument that schools in “recent decades” were preparing students for a diminishing pool of jobs. (The passage has a publication date of 1992, so the reference to “recent decades” would mean recent relative to 1992). Older workers were presumably educated years before this and may have been trained more appropriately for the workforce when they encountered it.
