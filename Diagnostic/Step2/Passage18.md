# Passage 18
Opera’s greatest contribution to American culture in the nineteenth century was the poetry of Walt Whitman. “But for opera,” he said, “I could never have written _Leaves of Grass_.” Music had awakened Whitman to the true beauty of the world. The music of city life, its rhythm and movement, galvanized his imagination. “That music always around me, increasing, unbeginning, yet long untaught I did not hear.”

He wanted to immerse himself in living, moving, speaking things. Brooklyn, where he lived, with its immigrant neighborhoods, its organ grinders performing in the streets —Brooklyn was “vocal and instrumental from one end to the other.” He found this spirit of movement on unlikely occasions—for instance, interviewing P. T. Barnum. “He told us about his tour through all the capitals of Europe and his intercourse with the kings, queens, and the big bugs. We asked him if anything he saw there made him love Yankeedom less. His grey eyes flashed: ‘My God!’ he said, ‘no! not a bit of it! Why, Sir, you can’t imagine the difference. There, everything is frozen—kings and things—formal, but absolutely frozen! Here it is _life_. Here it is freedom.’” Whitman concluded: “A whole book might be written on that little speech of Barnum’s.” One day such a book was written—a book of poetry.

The sound of a brass band, “some of the sweetest developments of the divine art,” first captured his interest in more formal music. (He couldn’t read music and had never received any training.) He liked massed sounds—groups of instruments rather than single ones. Above all, in his early years he admired the popular family vocal groups. Their vocal music was fit for “natural folk.” It was “heart singing,” the lusty music of the people, the choral music of democracy.

Opposed to this were the kinds of music he disliked—solo instruments, especially the shallow and tinkling piano, the affectations of the celebrated virtuosos (vocal and instrumental) of the day. Walt Whitman (1819–1892) came of age in the crude expansionism of Jacksonian America, bursting its geographical bonds, marching to the Pacific. Art singing was “the stale, second-hand, foreign method, with its flourishes, its ridiculous sentimentality, its anti-republican spirit, and its sycophantic tainting of the young taste of the nation!” The worst example of this kind of music was the florid Italian and French performance style he heard at Palmo’s opera house: “The trills, the agonized squalls, the lackadaisical drawlings, the sharp ear-piercing shrieks, the gurgling death-rattles.” He might have been an eighteenth-century Englishman confronted with the Italian opera of Handel’s day.

In 1847, the _Brooklyn Daily Eagle_ sent him to review opera at Astor Place. He was charmed by the “beautiful instrumentation” of _Il Barbieri di Siviglia_ and by the delicacy of some of the musical ideas. He heard _Lucia di Lammermoor_ and was moved by the music of the chorus and by the singing of Caterina Barilli-Patti, whose voice reminded him of an “exquisitely played flute, at once dazzling and soothing.” He suddenly _felt_ Italian opera and he began to revise his views. “Italian opera deserves a good degree of encouragement among us,” he wrote, but quickly added, in case anyone suspected he had gone soft, that love of opera need not be “anything to bow down to or servilely imitate.” Opera was drama, and it touched the understanding as well as feelings. So Whitman heartily approved of its being done in English.

  <summary>Question 100</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: a brass band.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, as it asks you to locate and understand a statement that the author makes explicitly in the text.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: organ grinders.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says that "The sound of a brass band…first captured his [Whitman's] interest in more formal music” (paragraph 3), not the sound of organ grinders.
<br><br>
Option B: vocal ensembles.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says that "The sound of a brass band…first captured his [Whitman's] interest in more formal music (paragraph 3), not the sound of vocal ensembles.
<br><br>
Option C: a brass band.
<br>
Correct. The passage says this quite clearly: "The sound of a brass band…first captured his [Whitman's] interest in more formal music (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option D: a celebrated singer.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says that a “brass band…first captured his [Whitman's] interest in more formal music (paragraph 3), not the sound of a celebrated singer.

  <summary>Question 101</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: energy.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to locate the part of the passage in which you can find this information and derive from the relevant section Barnum’s perspective on Europe.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: simplicity.
<br>
Incorrect. Barnum describes Europe as “formal” (paragraph 2), but this is not the same as decrying a lack of “simplicity” in Europe.
<br><br>
Option B: energy.
<br>
Correct. The passage says that when Whitman spoke with Barnum about Europe, Barnum replied "There, everything is frozen.…Here [in the United States] it is <i>life</i>…" (paragraph 2). “Energy” is the opposite of the stasis denoted by Barnum’s description of Europe as “frozen” and is consistent with Barnum’s description of Europe as without the “life” animating the U.S
<br><br>
Option C: democracy.
<br>
Incorrect. Despite the reference to kings in Europe (paragraph 2), there is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option D: humility.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.

  <summary>Question 102</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: folk rhythms of American operas about simple people.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the arguments made within the passage to novel scenarios not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: operas based on Germanic myths.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that Whitman disliked "Art singing…'the stale, second-hand, foreign method, with its flourishes, its ridiculous sentimentality…" (paragraph 4); furthermore, the passage indicates that he enjoyed "music of the people" (paragraph 3), so it is unlikely that he would be likely to enjoy music based on Germanic myths.
<br><br>
Option B: exalted serenity of medieval religious choirs.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that Whitman enjoyed "popular family vocal groups" (paragraph 3) because "Their vocal music was fit for 'natural folk'" (paragraph 3) so it is unlikely that he would have enjoyed the "exalted serenity of medieval religious choirs."
<br><br>
Option C: folk rhythms of American operas about simple people.
<br>
Correct. The passage indicates that Whitman enjoyed "popular family vocal groups" (paragraph 3) because "Their vocal music was fit for 'natural folk'" (paragraph 3) and "It was 'heart singing,' the lusty music of the people, the choral music of democracy" (paragraph 3), so it is likely that he would enjoy folk rhythms of American operas about so-called “simple” people.
<br><br>
Option D: vocal challenges of modern atonal operas.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the passage does indicate that Whitman enjoyed vocal music, there is no support for that of "modern atonal operas."

  <summary>Question 103</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: The qualities of flute music differ from those of the instruments he disliked.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to consider a potential tension or contradiction in the passage argument and then to consider which option would make the argument logically consistent.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: He preferred solo instruments to the orchestras used in operas.
<br>
Incorrect. This simply reinforces the first assertion discussed in the stem; it does not reconcile the contradiction presented.
<br><br>
Option B: The qualities of flute music differ from those of the instruments he disliked.
<br>
Correct. If the qualities of flute music differ from those of the instruments Whitman disliked, that would explain how he could simultaneously dislike solo instruments but speak favorably (as he does in paragraph 5) of a soprano voice that is like a flute.
<br><br>
Option C: He imagined that the flute was one of the instruments in a brass band.
<br>
Incorrect. This would not reconcile the information provided in the question because even if this were true, Whitman could still enjoy flutes only when they are part of an ensemble.
<br><br>
Option D: He meant to ridicule the affectation of the soprano’s trilling style.
<br>
Incorrect. The context in which the comparison of a soprano voice to an exquisitely played flute is made (paragraph 5) contradicts this option: Whitman "was moved…by the singing of Caterina Barilli-Patti, whose voice reminded him of an 'exquisitely played flute, at once dazzling and soothing" (paragraph 5).

  <summary>Question 104</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: approval of the enthusiastic nationalism of the times.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to draw on passage context to understand what the author implies, rather than explicitly states, about Whitman’s preferences and attractions.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: approval of the enthusiastic nationalism of the times.
<br>
Correct. The author tells us: “Above all, in his early years [Whitman] admired the popular family vocal groups. Their vocal music was fit for ‘natural folk.’ It was ’heart singing,’ the lusty music of the people, the choral music of democracy” (paragraph 3). Part of Whitman’s disdain for art singing was due to "its anti-republican spirit and its sycophantic tainting of the young taste of the nation!” (paragraph 4). All of these quotations suggest Whitman’s attraction to nationalism and his resistance to “art singing” on those grounds.
<br><br>
Option B: insensitivity to the beauty of classical music.
<br>
Incorrect. The final paragraph contradicts this option as the author writes: "[Whitman] was charmed by the 'beautiful instrumentation" of <i>Il Barbieri di Siviglia</i> and the delicacy of some of the musical ideas"; his described response to another Italian opera, <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>, further supports that he was not insensitive to the beauty of classical music.
<br><br>
Option C: unfamiliarity with the languages in which it was sung.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option; the passage does say that Whitman approved of Italian opera being done in English, but there is no connection made between his disdain for art singing and his unfamiliarity with the languages in which it was sung.
<br><br>
Option D: dislike of the instruments that accompanied the singers.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no mention in the passage of the instruments used to accompany art singing, so there is no support in the passage for this option.
