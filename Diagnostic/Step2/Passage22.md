# Passage 22
In an aggressively egalitarian society, _culture_ has always been a suspect word, suggesting the pretensions of an effete and foolish leisure class, like the grand dames spoofed in Marx Brothers’ films. But the pretensions of a self-appointed cultural elite notwithstanding, _culture_ actually refers to nothing more objectionable than a system of shared symbols and examples that hold a society together. Within a culture, we are kindred spirits, simply because we understand one another.

A recent and somewhat frightening study on the state of the humanities in U.S. life reported that the vast majority of even the most educated citizens are ignorant of the common literature and history that reinforce not only cultural identity but also moral choices. Doctors, lawyers, and business executives are in positions of great responsibility but often have little or no training in the ethical background that makes their critical choices meaningful.

Across the U.S., society finds itself increasingly fragmented, split into factions and “generation gaps”––which now occur at two- or three-year intervals––just because the once-automatic assumption of a shared culture, something beyond shared highways, television programming, and economic worries, is no longer valid.

In U.S. schools, the problem lies largely in what has recently been hailed as the back-to-basics movement, which includes no cultural content whatsoever, just skills and techniques. Reading is taught as a means of survival in the modern world, not as a source of pleasure and of shared experience. The notion of “great books” is viewed by most educators as an archaic concept, relegated to the museum of old teaching devices, such as the memorization in Greek of passages from Homer. But are “great books” (and legends, poems, paintings, and plays) indeed the only conduit of culture, or have they been replaced by more accessible and effortless media of transmission––television, for example, and films?

Films, to be sure, have entered into the U.S. cultural identity in an extremely powerful way; indeed, it is not clear that a person who knows nothing of Bogart or Chaplin, who has never seen (young) Brando or watched a Western could claim to be fully part of American culture. But these are classics, and they have some of the same virtue as great books: Their symbols, characters, and moral examples have been around long enough to span generations and segments of the population and to provide a shared vocabulary, shared heroes, and shared values.

No such virtue is to be found in the television series that disappear every two years (or less), in films that survive but a season, or in “made-for-TV” movies with a lifetime of two hours, minus commercial breaks. “Television culture” is no culture at all, and it is no surprise that when kids change heroes with the season, their parents don’t (and couldn’t possibly) keep up with them. The symbolism of _Moby Dick_ and _The Scarlet Letter_, however much one resented being force-fed them in school, is something everybody can be expected to share. The inanities of a television series, viewed by no matter how many millions of people, will not replace them. The U.S. is becoming a culture without a culture, lacking fixed points of reference and a shared vocabulary.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 123</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: the interests of an elite group.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify the meaning (and negative connotation) of a term in the context of its use in the passage. This is a fairly straightforward comprehension question because the language used in the answer is essentially a paraphrase of the author’s language.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: conflict between the generations.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author mentions "generation gaps" (paragraph 3) and implies, perhaps, that there may therefore be conflict between the generations, there is no relationship between these ideas and that of regarding culture with suspicion.
<br><br>
Option B: a system of shared symbols.
<br>
  Incorrect. Although the author defines <i>culture</i> as "a system of shared symbols" (first paragraph), he or she does not indicate that this is why it is sometimes viewed with suspicion. On the contrary, the author says that "<i>culture</i> actually refers to <i>nothing more objectionable than</i> a system of shared symbols…" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: the interests of an elite group.
<br>
  Correct. The author describes a popular understanding of <i>culture</i> in the first sentence of the opening paragraph, as well as describing the negative associations it carries: "In an aggressively egalitarian society, culture has always been a suspect word, suggesting the pretensions of an effete and foolish leisure class." This option is correct because it conveys that same understanding.
<br><br>
Option D: mutual understanding and kindred thought.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author does indicate that "Within a culture, we are kindred spirits, simply because we understand one another" (first paragraph), there is no indication that this is cause for suspicion.

  <summary>Question 124</summary>
  <b>The solution is C </b>: be more worthwhile than watching other made-for-television movies.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a scenario that is not described in the passage and asks you to apply your knowledge of the author’s argument to that hypothetical scenario.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: not be worthwhile, because it would not provide moral examples.
<br>
  Incorrect. The only aspect of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> mentioned by the author is that its symbolism is "something everybody can be expected to share" (final paragraph). Furthermore, the previous paragraph, with its reference to classics containing moral examples, suggests that <i>The Scarlet Letter would</i> provide moral examples.
<br><br>
Option B: be more worthwhile than reading the novel.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author does equate films with books in terms of their virtues (paragraph 5), no case is made for such an equation between television versions and books, let alone for the superiority of television versions over books. In fact, in the final paragraph, the author writes dismissively: “Television culture is no culture at all.”
<br><br>
Option C: be more worthwhile than watching other made-for-television movies.
<br>
Correct. The author says that "No such virtue [referring to the "provision of a shared vocabulary, shared heroes, and shared values"] is to be found in … made-for-TV' movies" (final paragraph), but goes on to say that "The symbolism of … <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> … is something everybody can be expected to share." This option is correct because one can thus surmise that the author would believe that watching a television version of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> would be more worthwhile than watching other made-for-television movies.
<br><br>
Option D: be more worthwhile than watching a classic film.
<br>
Incorrect. To the contrary, the author attributes some value to films: “Films, to be sure, have entered into the U.S. cultural identity in an extremely powerful way” (paragraph 5). Of television, however, the author writes: “television culture is no culture at all” (final paragraph).

  <summary>Question 125</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: The films of Charlie Chaplin

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the author’s perspective or point of view about different cultural figures mentioned in the passage. To answer the question, you need to be able to assess from the mentions of the cultural figures how the author views each of them.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The films of Charlie Chaplin
<br>
Correct. The author says "it is not clear that a person who knows nothing of … Chaplin … could claim to be fully part of American culture" (paragraph 5); this clearly indicates the author’s belief that Chaplin occupies an important place in a “shared” American culture.
<br><br>
Option B: The music of the Beatles
<br>
Incorrect. Although it is plausible that culture as the author describes it could include music, the author never refers to music as a central cultural form. Further, the author does not mention the Beatles, and there is thus no passage support for consideration of the Beatles as among the classics, given the author's definition of classics: "Their symbols, characters, and moral examples have been around long enough to span generations and segments of the population and to provide a shared vocabulary, shared heroes, and shared values” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: A television comedy
<br>
Incorrect. The author clearly states that he does not consider television as an important part of “shared U.S. culture: "'Television culture' is no culture at all …" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: A biography of Marlon Brando
<br>
Incorrect. The author considers "great books" (paragraph 4) and at least one Brando film (paragraph 5) to be an important part of a shared U.S. culture, but there is no indication that he or she would think that a biography of Marlon Brando would be a great book.

  <summary>Question 126</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: the notion of “great books” is increasingly viewed as archaic.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a hypothetical scenario not mentioned in the passage, then asks what effect that scenario would have on passage claims. This question thus asks you to incorporate or integrate additional information back into the passage, to assess the effect of such information on the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the notion of “great books” is increasingly viewed as archaic.
<br>
Correct. In praising classic films, the author also describes the virtues of “great books": " Their symbols, characters, and moral examples have been around long enough to span generations and segments of the population and to provide a shared vocabulary, shared heroes, and shared values" (paragraph 5). Accordingly, mystery novels, "which are not generally considered classics," would not be "great books"; so if books that are not "great books" are now studied in college English courses, that would strongly support the author's assertion that the notion of "great books" is increasingly viewed as archaic.
<br><br>
Option B: the “great books” have been replaced by more accessible media.
<br>
Incorrect. The author identifies television and film as "more accessible … media" (paragraph 4); there is no particular reason to assume that mystery novels would also fall into that category.
<br><br>
Option C: reading is taught solely as a survival skill.
<br>
Incorrect. Given the context in which this phrase appears ("Reading is taught as a means of survival <i>in the modern world</i>" - paragraph 4), it is unlikely the mentioned mystery novels are being taught "as a survival skill" (that is, as a matter of literacy to negotiate daily living).
<br><br>
Option D: even the most educated citizens are largely ignorant of literature and history.
<br>
Incorrect. Just because such courses are offered, this does not necessarily mean other courses that teach the literature and history the author values are not offered.

  <summary>Question 127</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: more people in the U.S. will find shared culture in Moby Dick than in a television series, no matter how popular the series.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to consider the implications of the author’s use of evidence to assess which conclusions you can reasonably make based on that evidence. Thus, you need to assess the logical relations between a passage claim or discussion and the author’s argument
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: most people in the U.S. have been force-fed <i>Moby Dick</i> in school.
<br>
Incorrect. The author simply writes: "however much one resented being force-fed them [the classics, including Moby Dick] in school" (final paragraph)—which does not necessarily mean that <i>most</i> people have been force-fed them. Certainly, plenty of students might have read these books willingly or happily, even if some considered the texts to have been “force[d” on them.
<br><br>
Option B: most people in the U.S. consider television to be simplistic and inane.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for most people believing that statement, even if the author might agree with it.
<br><br>
Option C: more people in the U.S. read great literature than watch television.
<br>
Incorrect. "The inanities of a television series, <i>viewed by no matter how many millions of people</i> …" (final paragraph), along with the earlier mention of] the notion of "great books" becoming archaic implies that more people watch television than read great literature.
<br><br>
  Option D: more people in the U.S. will find shared culture in <i>Moby Dick</i> than in a television series, no matter how popular the series.
<br>
  Correct. The author says "The symbolism of <i>Moby Dick</i> and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, however much one resented being force-fed them in school, is something everybody can be expected to share. The inanities of a television series, viewed by no matter how many millions of people, will not replace them. The U.S. is becoming a culture without a culture” (final paragraph). The author clearly believes that what he or she calls the “great books” contribute to a shared culture, and that television cannot provide this.

  <summary>Question 128</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Without a common culture, the members of a society cannot easily band together.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply the passage argument outside the context of the passage—to predict the potential consequences of the argument beyond the immediate circumstances discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: A society with a shared culture will have few economic problems.
<br>
Incorrect. The author mentions "economic worries" simply as something we share (paragraph 3), but never suggests that a shared culture would mitigate economic challenges.
<br><br>
Option B: Without a common culture, the members of a society cannot easily band together.
<br>
  Correct. The author says "<i>culture</i> actually refers to nothing more objectionable than a system of shared symbols and examples that hold a society together. Within a culture, we are kindred spirits, simply because we understand one another" (first paragraph); these two statements provide support for this option.
<br><br>
Option C: In societies where there is little television programming, the people have less cultural identity.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is incorrect because the final paragraph maintains that television, unlike great books and film classics, does not contribute to cultural identity. The author, then, would not see a dearth of television programming as limiting the potential for shared cultural identity.
<br><br>
Option D: A society's "great books" are intended for the leisure class, not ordinary people.
<br>
Incorrect. The author describes the associations between culture and a “leisure class” as part of the reason that “culture” has been viewed with suspicion in the United States (first paragraph). He views the “great books,” however, as intended for all Americans and as potentially providing a shared cultural identity (final paragraph). The author does not, then, endorse the view that “great” literature is intended primarily for the “leisure class.”
