# Passage 25
During the 1930s, partly as a result of the Great Depression and partly as a more gradual response to changes attendant on industrialization and urbanization, many U.S. citizens became convinced that expanded governmental welfare efforts were needed to complement individual efforts. The passage of the Social Security Act in 1935, with such key provisions as unemployment compensation and old age and survivors insurance, became possible because of this shift in public thinking. When Gallup asked a cross-section of U.S. citizens in 1936 whether they favored a “compulsory old age insurance plan ... which requires employers and workers to make equal contributions to workers’ pensions,” 68 percent replied that they did. From this base, support grew rapidly.

In recent years, Social Security taxes have risen dramatically because benefit levels have been raised and the proportion of the employed paying into the system has declined relative to the proportion drawing benefits. Because of this situation, questions have arisen about the possibility that public support would erode. The answer is clear. The increases in Social Security benefits have been substantial, but few workers describe them as “too high.”

Even more striking, given the sharp rise in employee payroll taxes for the program, is that most people do not believe that Social Security taxes are too high. During debate in the 1980s over the measures that should be taken to solve the growing financial problems of the Social Security system, polls repeatedly asked the public to choose one of two proposed means of bringing receipts and expenditures into balance, increasing taxes or reducing benefits. The response was always the same: If a choice must be made, raise taxes rather than cut benefits. More recently, respondents by a roughly three-to-one margin have expressed their opposition to limiting cost‑of‑living adjustments for Social Security recipients in order to reduce the federal budget deficit.

These responses attest to the prophetic character of President Franklin Roosevelt’s remarks at the time the bill was enacted. Responding to the argument that since many working‑class families would have to contribute as much as those in higher‑income brackets, payroll deductions would be regressive taxes relative to income tax, which is graduated, the president observed: “I guess you’re right on the economics, but those taxes were never a problem of economics. They are politics, all the way through. We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.”

Social Security was never welfare. Its benefits were to be bought and paid for by individuals to provide for their economic security and well‑being. Roosevelt’s initial idea of a system in which each worker earned future benefits through regular payroll deductions was a shrewd reading of U.S. values. Workers wanted to “pay their share.” In 1938, Gallup asked the public whether the Social Security law should be changed so that employers paid the whole amount.

The idea might have seemed attractive—what worker would not want to be freed from having to make payments or would resist having employers foot the whole bill? But regardless of income, only 15 percent of those surveyed favored changing the law to eliminate the tax on individual workers. Social Security is still a broadly supported program for which U.S. workers are prepared to make sacrifices (in the form of higher payroll taxes) so that a rise in benefits can be sustained.

  <summary>Question 142</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: a refutation of allegations of growing dissatisfaction with Social Security.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to assess the author’s primary approach to the topic throughout the passage. This requires you to evaluate the author’s tone and purpose as well as identifying his or her argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a defense of the consistent fairness of the Social Security system.
<br>
Incorrect. The issue addressed by the author is not fairness, but public support for the Social Security system: the second paragraph conveys this clearly.
<br><br>
Option B: a refutation of allegations of growing dissatisfaction with Social Security.
<br>
Correct. "In recent years, Social Security taxes have risen dramatically … Because of this situation, questions have arisen about the possibility that public support would erode. The answer is clear.…[F]ew workers describe them as 'too high'" (paragraph 2). Here, the author challenges, or refutes, a common argument about public attitudes towards Social Security and then focuses much of the rest of the passage on the support for the program.
<br><br>
Option C: an attack on those who have raised questions about the need for Social Security.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not attack those who have raised questions about the program; the tone of the passage is measured and historically based.
<br><br>
Option D: a tribute to the prophetic powers of President Franklin Roosevelt.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does refer to “the prophetic character of President Franklin Roosevelt’s remarks at the time the bill was enacted” (paragraph 4). But Roosevelt is mentioned to support a point about the “politics” of Social Security and the ways in which it was designed to ensure public support for the program; the point of the passage is certainly not to make a claim about Roosevelt’s ability to predict the future.

  <summary>Question 143</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: relatively regressive.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to make an inference about a statement that the author would endorse, based on a closely related statement made by the author in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: relatively regressive.
<br>
Correct. These responses attest to the prophetic character of President Franklin Roosevelt’s remarks at the time the bill was enacted. Responding to the argument that . . . payroll deductions would be regressive taxes relative to income tax, which is graduated, the president observed: “I guess you’re right on the economics” (paragraph 4). The author’s words “attest” and “prophetic,” as well as the absence of challenge indicate author agreement.
<br><br>
Option B: a form of welfare tax.
<br>
Incorrect. The author maintains: "Social Security was never welfare" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: not economically sound.
<br>
Incorrect. The author’s claim: "Social Security is still a broadly supported program for which U. S. workers are prepared to make sacrifices (in the form of higher payroll taxes) so that a rise in benefits can be sustained" (final paragraph) suggests that the author views the program as economically sound.
<br><br>
Option D: disliked by younger workers.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the survey described in the first paragraph, which reveals 68% in favor —and asked a <i>cross-section</i> of U. S. citizens—was conducted in 1936, the next paragraph describes the situation in "In recent years …" as still being one of public support. Further, paragraph 3 refers to polls in the 1980s indicating continuing public support, though we don't know if younger workers were included in those polls. In any case, the passage never indicates that the tax is disliked by younger workers.

  <summary>Question 144</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: purchased by each recipient.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it tests your understanding of a paraphrase of a point made explicitly by the author.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: purchased by each recipient.
<br>
Correct. The author clearly supports this statement: The “benefits [of Social Security] were to be bought and paid for by individuals to provide for their economic security and well-being." (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option B: received regardless of need.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not talk about the economic need of recipients of Social Security.
<br><br>
Option C: contributed to by employers.
<br>
Incorrect. Although true, this is not the reason that the author gives to explain why workers do not consider the program to be welfare (especially since people don't want their employers to pay for it completely: “Workers wanted to 'pay their share'" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: meant to replace lost income.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in the passage to support this option.

  <summary>Question 145</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: maintaining cost of living adjustments.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that tests your ability to locate and understand a point made explicitly in the passage, with language close to that used in the option.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: maintaining cost of living adjustments.
<br>
Correct. The author explicitly supports this point: "More recently, respondents by a roughly three-to-one margin have expressed their <i>opposition to limiting cost-of-living adjustments</i> for Social Security recipients…" (paragraph 3, emphasis added).
<br><br>
Option B: cutting costs to help lower the federal deficit.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this option in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: having employers bear the brunt of increased contributions.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates the opposite: "In 1938, Gallup asked the public whether the Social Security law should be changed so that employers paid the whole amount" (paragraph 5); "…only 15 percent of those surveyed favored changing the law to eliminate the tax on individual workers" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: replacing the program with incentives for private initiative.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this option in the passage; everything in the passage indicates public support for the system’s current mode of operation.

  <summary>Question 146</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: the proportion of people paying into the system to those drawing benefits is declining.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to demonstrate understanding of a causal claim made by the author in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the real value of benefits has been declining since the 1930s.
<br>
Incorrect. Such a decline is not mentioned in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: taxes for the program have been rising faster than its benefits.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does indicate that taxes for the program have been rising (paragraph 2) but does not say that they have been doing so "faster than its benefits".
<br><br>
Option C: an increasing number of workers are supporting a declining number of beneficiaries.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates the opposite: "the proportion of the employed paying into the system has declined relative to the proportion drawing benefits" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option D: the proportion of people paying into the system to those drawing benefits is declining.
<br>
Correct. The author provides this explanation for the questioning about the strength of public support for the program: "…the proportion of the employed paying into the system has declined relative to the proportion drawing benefits. Because of this situation, questions have arisen about the possibility that public support would erode." (paragraph 2).
