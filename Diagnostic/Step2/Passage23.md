Are not the godlike tragic figures of drama flawed in such a way that no matter what their aims or how great their abilities, they are certain to make a misstep? Is it not precisely the burden of tragedy to report the course by which the great must inevitably destroy themselves? We answer “yes” to these questions almost by reflex. The tragic figure is possessed by jealousy, pride, ambition, or some other of the deadly sins to follow a blind, raging course that must bring a descent into blood.

Among the Greeks, it was the function of the goddess Nemesis to exact divine retribution for human excesses due to insolence and presumption—an attitude that we usually call _hubris_—and a generalized concept of Nemesis has continued to lie in wait for the too-bold tragic figure. For a great crime, great punishment: That is the point that tragedy makes.

But taken as a whole, tragedy makes no such point. The human flaw does _not_ always exist in tragedy—and tragedy cannot be defined or explained by it. There are certainly tragic characters who _seem_ in some way flawed, although we would usually have great difficulty in saying just what has flawed them. But there are tragic characters who seem altogether unstained but suffer nonetheless; some of them have been explained by some commentators as saints. We also see many flawed characters without tragic dimensions.

If we refuse to acknowledge that many kinds of tragic figure exist, we begin our investigation with a flaw in our own eye. Our focus is narrower than the form being investigated. We have come by this narrowness naturally enough. We are bound in reverence to attend to Aristotle; he is the only philosopher-critic to have written extensively about tragedy while tragedy was first in the process of defining itself. And in speaking of the kind of dramatic figure who best suited the plotting of tragedy, he gave us the clue that we have hardened into “flaw.”

The figure who serves the tragic plot most satisfactorily, he tells us, is one whose misfortune is brought about not by consistent vice or willfulness but by some error of judgment. Geniuses as well as the wholly virtuous make errors of judgment. In practice, we have assumed that by “error of judgment,” Aristotle really meant an aberration brought about by one or another form of self-indulgence.

The flaw was a clean and comfortable way of explaining the tragic progression when the time came, during the Renaissance, to renew the bloodlines of the form; furthermore, it very readily fit the prevalent concept of the relation between sin and punishment. Not surprisingly, drama after the Renaissance _does_ display a flawed protagonist more regularly and more explicitly than Greek drama ever did. The presumed pattern is reinforced by our tendency to think of tragedy as moral illustration.

What the play seems to be saying—and what it occasionally _is_ saying—closely coincides with what moralists so accurately say from their pulpits: Surrender to your temptation, whatever it may be, and you will suffer for it. For an audience moving back and forth between stage and pulpit, the habit of identifying the exhortation with the dramatic persona becomes increasingly easy. Out of moral anxiety—out of unquestioned habit, really—we have come to imagine the fatal flaw as the cause of each private doom and public dilemma. Yet the flaw is a concept that becomes maddeningly elusive under the most cursory examination of actual plays.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 129</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: too facile a way of interpreting tragedies.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to make an inference about the author’s argument, which is not stated directly but is implied as an answer to a rhetorical question.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: irrelevant to the downfall of tragic figures.
<br>
Incorrect. This is too sweeping a statement to be justified by the author’s claim: "The human flaw does not always exist in tragedy" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: too facile a way of interpreting tragedies.
<br>
Correct. The author asks in the first paragraph: “Is it not precisely the burden of tragedy to report the course by which the great must inevitably destroy themselves? We answer “yes” to these questions almost by reflex.” The author’s view on this question then unfolds in the next two paragraphs: “But taken as a whole, tragedy makes no such point. The human flaw does not <i>always</i> exist in a tragedy—and tragedy cannot be defined or explained by it" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option C: a standard plot device in classical dramas.
<br>
Incorrect. The author implies that “classical dramas” are the Greek dramas, or the tragedies that Aristotle wrote about “while tragedy was first in the process of defining itself” (paragraph 4). But the author argues that this idea of the fatal, or tragic character flaw is “too narrow” (paragraph 4), too “clean and comfortable” (paragraph 6) to describe the nature of a character’s challenge or tragedy in classic dramas. The author argues that readers <i>believe</i> in this “tragic flaw” as a “standard plot device,” rather than that it really is such a device.
<br><br>
Option D: the feature that defines a work as tragic.
<br>
Incorrect. "The human flaw does not always exist in tragedy" (paragraph 3), so it cannot define a work as tragic.

  <summary>Question 130</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: they were the only analysis of the form that was written while it was being developed.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a basic Comprehension question that asks you to identify information that is stated explicitly in the passage; the correct answer uses language that is close to the passage language, but does require you to recognize a paraphrase.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: their characterization of the tragic figure was confirmed in the work of later playwrights.
<br>
Incorrect. Although later drama (Renaissance drama) confirmed the flaw (paragraph 6) as a way of explaining the tragic progression, it wasn't necessarily Aristotle's writings, nor his particular conception of the flaw, that was actually confirmed. The author suggests, in fact, that later readers to some extent distorted Aristotle’s emphasis on characters’ “errors in judgment” into a focus on a great moral flaw.
<br><br>
Option B: they were the only analysis of the form that was written while it was being developed.
<br>
Correct. The author states this clearly: "We are bound in reverence to attend to Aristotle; he is the only philosopher-critic to have written extensively about tragedy while tragedy was first in the process of defining itself" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option C: they appealed to the common wish to see the great suffer for their transgressions.
<br>
Incorrect. Although this might seem to be a plausible inference, because the author refers to "the prevalent concept of the relation between sin and punishment" (paragraph 6) and to "our tendency to think of tragedy as moral illustration" (paragraph 6), <i>and</i> Aristotle's conception of flaw as error in judgment, the author does not actually suggest that there is a “common wish to see the great suffer.” This is an unjustified claim.
<br><br>
Option D: they defined tragedy in a way that was understandable and easily recognized.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not suggest that Aristotle’s writing was easily understood; in fact, the author points to some common misunderstandings of Aristotle (paragraph 5).

  <summary>Question 131</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: No examples of dissimilar tragic figures are cited.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to evaluate the soundness of the author’s argument. To answer this question, you need to determine which options accurately describe the passage as well as which options identify a weakness in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: No examples of dissimilar tragic figures are cited.
<br>
Correct. The author mentions tragic figures who are not flawed figures in paragraph 3, but the rest of the passage addresses only flawed characters, even as the author argues that focusing on the “flaw” in characters is too limited a way to understand tragedy (paragraph 4, for instance).
<br><br>
Option B: The author presumes to know the reader’s beliefs.
<br>
Incorrect. In the first paragraph, the author presumes to know that “we” tend to see the tragic figure as somehow flawed, but this is less a presumption about the beliefs of the individual reader than a recognition (supported by the discussion of Aristotle in paragraph 4) that the critical reception of tragedy since Aristotle has focused on a “flawed” character.
<br><br>
Option C: In tragic dramas, misdeeds are always punished.
<br>
Incorrect. The author indicates that we have come to expect this from tragedy but describing this expectation is not a weakness of the passage argument.
<br><br>
Option D: All literary forms have features in common.
<br>
Incorrect. This is irrelevant to the passage, and certainly doesn't indicate a weakness of it.

  <summary>Question 132</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: The fact that comedy can result from a flawed hero indicates that a character flaw is not unique to tragedies.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which presents information that is not included in the passage and asks you to assess how this information would support the passage argument. In looking for the relation between supporting evidence and passage arguments, this question also gives you practice in skills that are tested in Reasoning Within the Text questions.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The fact that Keaton’s efforts always increase his problems indicates that his films are really tragedies based on a character flaw.
<br>
Incorrect. This may seem to be an attractive choice, as Keaton’s character makes an error in judgment, which Aristotle suggests often befalls the character in a tragedy (paragraph 5). In fact, however, the author critiques the overly schematic notion of tragedy that we have taken from Aristotle and argues instead: “The human flaw does <i>not</i> always exist in tragedy—and tragedy cannot be defined or explained by it” (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: The fact that silly attempts to be helpful produce slapstick comedy indicates that serious attempts to cause harm define tragedy.
<br>
Incorrect. Silly attempts to be helpful are not serious attempts to cause harm; furthermore, the passage doesn't argue that serious attempts to cause harm define tragedy.
<br><br>
Option C: The fact that Keaton’s arbitrary choice of a poor solution is comic indicates that characters who have no choices are tragic.
<br>
Incorrect. Keaton's arbitrary choice of a poor solution does not show a character without choices; furthermore, the passage does not say that "characters who have no choices are tragic."
<br><br>
Option D: The fact that comedy can result from a flawed hero indicates that a character flaw is not unique to tragedies.
<br>
Correct. The passage says that "We also see many flawed characters without tragic dimensions" (paragraph 3). If Keaton is seen as a flawed character (making poor or self-destructive decisions) in the context of comedy rather than tragedy, this option is correct.

<details>
  <summary>Question 133</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: does not necessitate their downfall.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to assess the role in the author’s argument of an example the author discusses in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: is not the reason for their actions.
<br>
Incorrect. The author writes: “But there are tragic characters who seem altogether unstained but suffer nonetheless; some of them have been explained by some commentators as saints” (paragraph 3). The author’s concern here is not “the reason for the [characters’] actions”; the author’s concern is the reason for their tragedy.
<br><br>
Option B: varies in response to the situation.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not supported by the passage; there is no reference to situational elements.
<br><br>
Option C: does not necessitate their downfall.
<br>
Correct. The author uses this example to show that it is not the “nature” of the characters that causes their tragedy, or their “downfall”: The human flaw does <i>not</i> always exist in tragedy—and tragedy cannot be defined or explained by it….[T]here are tragic characters who seem altogether unstained but suffer nonetheless; some of them have been explained by some commentators as saints” (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option D: compels them to act willfully.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not supported by the passage. The author is not concerned with locating a particular, overarching “flaw” (such as willfulness) that would explain the suffering of characters judged to be saintly.

  <summary>Question 134</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: earnestly assertive.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to evaluate or describe the author’s way of addressing the reader in the passage; this requires you to look at rhetorical choices made by the author and to understand these in the context of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: impartially questioning.
<br>
Incorrect. "But taken as a whole, tragedy makes no such point" (paragraph 3) is not impartial, nor is "If we refuse to acknowledge that many kinds of tragic figure exist, we begin our investigation with a flaw in our own eye" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option B: earnestly assertive.
<br>
Correct. "But taken as a whole, tragedy makes no such point" (paragraph 3) is assertive, as is "If we refuse to acknowledge that many kinds of tragic figure exist, we begin our investigation with a flaw in our own eye" (paragraph 4). Furthermore, "we begin our investigation with a flaw in our own eye" (paragraph 4) and "What the play seems to be saying…" (final paragraph ) are serious and earnest statements.
<br><br>
Option C: genially confiding.
<br>
Incorrect. To be confiding, there must be a secret or at least a particular familiarity that the author conveys, neither of which apply to this passage. Further, the author’s tone is earnest, treating the topic as consequential, not “genial.” The final statement in the passage, for instance, is clearly serious rather than cheerful: “Yet the flaw is a concept that becomes <i>maddeningly elusive</i> under the most cursory examination of actual plays” (emphasis added).
<br><br>
Option D: sternly accusing.
<br>
Incorrect. The author treats the topic as important but is thoughtful and careful at each step of the argument, rather than “stern” or “accusing.” For instance, the author seeks to understand the source of what he or she sees as a misunderstanding of Aristotle: “We have come by this narrowness naturally enough” (paragraph 4).

<details>
  <summary>Question 135</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: to read test questions carefully before answering them.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply an argument made in the passage—in this case, the view of the tragic character as described by Aristotle- to novel situations that are not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: to read test questions carefully before answering them.
<br>
Correct. The passage author describes Aristotle’s views: “The figure who serves the tragic plot most satisfactorily, [Aristotle] tells us, is one whose misfortune is brought about not by consistent vice or willfulness but by some error of judgment…” (paragraph 5). This advice, avoiding carelessness or hurrying through work, (likely an “error in judgment”), would follow the guidance the author attributes to Aristotle.
<br><br>
Option B: to study regularly to combat habits of procrastination.
<br>
Incorrect. Procrastination, described in this option, is closer to a “vice,” or to “willfulness,” than it is an “error in judgment.” Because Aristotle’s views, according to the passage, focused on the tragic figure whose “misfortune” stems “<i>not</i> from consistent vice or willfulness,” the advice given in this option would not be the advice given by someone who accepts Aristotle’s views.
<br><br>
Option C: to change their contemptuous attitude toward others.
<br>
Incorrect. The author tells us that the tragic figure, in Aristotle’s view, is “one whose misfortune is brought about not by consistent vice or willfulness….” Contempt for others would be a vice, and thus this advice would not be aligned with Aristotle’s views.
<br><br>
Option D: to seek counseling about compulsive perfectionism.
<br>
Incorrect. “Compulsive perfectionism” would be a vice, not an “error in judgment,” and thus this advice would not be aligned with Aristotle’s views, as the author explains them.

  <summary>Question 136</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: a need by society for affirmation that misdeeds will be appropriately punished.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to make an inference from the author’s statements about the assumptions that underline the author’s statements.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a need by society for affirmation that misdeeds will be appropriately punished.
<br>
Correct. The author says, "The presumed pattern [that sin is punished] is reinforced by our tendency to think of tragedy as moral illustration" (paragraph 6). This is further supported by the final paragraph, with its references to moralists who say, "Surrender to your temptation, whatever it may be, and you will suffer for it" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: an assumption by the playwright that great drama must concern suffering.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for any assumption by the playwright.
<br><br>
Option C: a perverse compulsion to self-destruction inherent in their character.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that the tragic figure has "jealousy, pride, ambition, or some other of the deadly sins" (first paragraph), so there is no implied assumption of a perverse compulsion to self-destruction.
<br><br>
Option D: the classical convention that the gods choose arbitrary victims.
<br>
Incorrect. This contradicts the second paragraph; Nemesis exacts retribution "for human excesses…" (paragraph 2).
