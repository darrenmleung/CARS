# Passage 11
Cheap, superficial, intrusive, unfounded, even vicious: Surely gossip can be all that. Yet to define it in these ways is to overlook the whole network of human exchanges of information, the need to inquire and to learn from the experience of others and the importance of not taking everything at face value. The desire for such knowledge leads people to go beneath the surface of what is said and shown and to try to unravel conflicting clues and seemingly false leads.

In order to do so, information has to be shared with others, obtained from them, stored in memory for future use, tested and evaluated in discussion, and used at times to encourage, to entertain, or to warn. Everyone has a special interest in personal information about others. If we knew about people only what they wished to reveal, we would be subjected to ceaseless manipulation; and we would be deprived of the pleasure and suspense that comes from trying to understand them.

I shall define _gossip_ as informal personal communication about other people who are absent or treated as absent. It lacks formal rules setting forth who may speak and in what manner and with what limitations from the point of view of accuracy and reliability. It takes place spontaneously and relies on humor and guesswork, and it is casual with respect to who ends up receiving the information, in spite of the frequent promises not to repeat it that are ritualistically exacted along its path.

The elements of gossip are clearly not morally problematic in their own right. However, the informality and the speculative nature of what is said may be inappropriate, as it would be if gossip were the basis for firing people from their jobs. The communication about other persons may be of a degrading or invasive nature that renders it inappropriate. And the talk about persons in their absence is sometimes of such a nature as to require that it either be spoken to their faces or not spoken at all.

Not all gossip, as I have defined it, is injurious or otherwise to be avoided. But when it is, it can harm all who take part in it. Out of respect for oneself as much as for others, therefore, it matters to discern such cases. Three categories of gossip should be singled out as especially reprehensible: gossip in breach of confidence, gossip the speaker knows to be false, and unduly invasive gossip.

Gossip can be an intoxicating surrogate for genuine efforts to understand. It can be the vehicle for stereotypes—of class, for instance, or race, or sex. It turns easily into a habit, and for some, a necessity. They may then become unable to think of other human beings in other than trivial ways. If they cannot attribute scope and depth and complexity to others, moreover, it is unlikely that they will perceive these dimensions in themselves. All news may strike them as reducible to certain trite formulas about human behavior.

Those whose casual talk stops at no boundaries, leaves no secret untouched, may thereby shut themselves off from the understanding they seem to seek. Gossip can be the means whereby they distance themselves from all those about whom they speak with such seeming familiarity, and they may achieve but spurious intimacy with those with whom they speak. In this way, gossip can deny full meaning and depth to human beings.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 59</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: A committee of supervisors meets to make promotion decisions about workers.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply what you have learned from the passage to a situation outside of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: A committee of supervisors meets to make promotion decisions about workers.
<br>
Correct. This option describes a situation that is formal, planned, and likely to have some "formal rules setting forth who may speak and in what manner and with what limitations from the point of view of accuracy and reliability" (paragraph 3) Each element clearly distinguishes the meeting from situations that promote gossip, as the author describes these situations, so it is unlikely that gossip will occur during the meeting.
<br><br>
Option B: The question of the health of an elderly relative arises at a family dinner.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in this description that precludes gossip; in fact, because it is a spontaneous and informal discussion without formal rules about someone who is likely absent—four elements of gossip as it is defined in the passage (paragraph 3)—it is plausible that gossip will occur.
<br><br>
Option C: Someone asks a group of friends for advice about a marital problem.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in this description that precludes gossip. It is an informal discussion without formal rules that may well be spontaneous and concerns someone who is presumably absent (the spouse of the person asking for advice). Because these are the four elements of gossip as it is defined in the passage (paragraph 3), it is plausible that gossip will occur.
<br><br>
Option D: Two strangers in adjacent airplane seats find that they have the same dentist.
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in this description that precludes gossip; it is an informal and spontaneous discussion and to some extent about someone who is absent (the dentist is presumably not on the plane). As three elements of gossip as it is defined in paragraph 3 are present, it is plausible that gossip will occur.

  <summary>Question 60</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: decisions about people should not be based on unproven allegations.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to identify the assumptions or implied beliefs of the author, which affect his or her argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: privileged information allows people to profit at the expense of others.
<br>
Incorrect. The author defines gossip as by definition as “about people who are absent or treated as absent” (paragraph 3), and as the author defends the informational value of gossip in at least some circumstances, there is no implication that “truth” depends on the presence of the person being discussed.
<br><br>
Option B: the truth cannot be known unless the person being discussed is present.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: speculative communication is of value only as entertainment.
<br>
Incorrect. In the first paragraph, the author defends the value of some gossip: “To define [gossip] in [only negative] ways is to overlook the whole network of human exchanges of information, the need to inquire and to learn from the experience of others and the importance of not taking everything at face value.” The author goes on to define gossip as inherently speculative: “It takes place spontaneously and relies on humor and guesswork” (paragraph 3, emphasis added). So, as the author defends the informational purpose of some gossip and gossip is speculative by definition, she does not suggest that speculative communication is only for entertainment value.
<br><br>
Option D: decisions about people should not be based on unproven allegations.
<br>
Correct. "…the informality and the speculative nature of what is said may be inappropriate, as it would be if gossip were the basis for firing people from their jobs" (paragraph 4) indicates that the author believes that decisions about people should not be based on unproven allegations.

  <summary>Question 61</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: Covert gestures and grimaces among audience members to express their opinion of a lecturer

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question; it asks you to apply the author’s arguments to assess which scenario (not described in the passage) is most analogous to the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: An open announcement by electronic mail warning about a computer virus in certain software
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that spontaneity is one of the elements of gossip (paragraph 3), and this option does not describe a spontaneous communication.
<br><br>
Option B: A political cartoon depicting a particular senator as a cat in the lap of a lobbyist
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that spontaneity and informality are two of the elements of gossip (paragraph 3), and this option describes a communication that is neither spontaneous nor informal.
<br><br>
Option C: A witness implicating someone in a crime by pointing to that person in a police lineup
<br>
Incorrect. The passage describes gossip as lacking "formal rules setting forth who may speak and in what manner and with what limits from the point of view of accuracy and reliability" (paragraph 3); the situation described in this option surely does not lack such rules.
<br><br>
Option D: Covert gestures and grimaces among audience members to express their opinion of a lecturer
<br>
Correct. The communication described in this option is informal and casual, and the lecturer is treated as absent, all of which are elements of gossip according to the passage author (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 62</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: can prevent genuine intimacy and understanding.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to recognize the author’s central argument or purpose in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: can prevent genuine intimacy and understanding.
<br>
  Correct. The passage says gossip can be "an intoxicating <i>surrogate</i> for genuine efforts to understand" (paragraph 6). It also says gossip can be "the vehicle for stereotypes" and some people "may then become unable to think of other human beings in other than trivial ways" (paragraph 6). These points are elaborated upon with mention of people who gossip shutting themselves off from the understanding they seem to seek…" and a conclusion of, "they may achieve but spurious intimacy…. In this way, gossip can deny full meaning and depth to human beings" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: is not an important or effective way to convey information.
<br>
Incorrect. The first two paragraphs imply the contrary.
<br><br>
Option C: is often a harmless and agreeable social activity.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author concedes that "Not all gossip…is injurious" (paragraph 5), there is no support for "often"; furthermore, whether gossip is or isn't injurious is not the central thesis of the passage, as it is addressed only in paragraph 5.
<br><br>
Option D: tends to become manipulative and denigrating.
<br>
Incorrect. That gossip may be "degrading" is mentioned in paragraph 4, but there is no support in the passage for the claim that it "tends to" be; furthermore, this is not the main thesis of the passage, which is presented mostly in paragraph 6 and the final paragraph.

  <summary>Question 63</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: someone who contributes to such talk reveals a moral weakness.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to understand the implications or connotations of a specific phrase of the author’s, in the context in which it is used in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: someone who is discussed might learn of the gossip and feel hurt.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author clearly identifies injury and harm that can result from gossip, the reason for mentioning “reprehensible” kinds of gossip is not what is described in this option, partly because the author doesn't mention such discovery, partly because the harm is not dependent on such discovery, and partly because the author says injurious gossip can harm "all who take part in it" (paragraph 5), rather than just the person discussed.
<br><br>
Option B: someone whose confidence is betrayed will be unlikely to reveal other secrets.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no mention of this in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: someone who contributes to such talk reveals a moral weakness.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: “Three categories of gossip should be singled out as especially reprehensible: gossip in breach of confidence, gossip the speaker knows to be false, and unduly invasive gossip” (paragraph 5). All three examples implicate morality: breaking a promise, lying, and violating another's right to privacy.
<br><br>
Option D: someone who listens to such talk is likely to be mistrusted by others present.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not imply this description of gossip in the passage.

<details>
  <summary>Question 64</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: An inability to appreciate one’s own complexity

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it requires you to evaluate the relative importance of the author’s several critiques of gossip and to judge the priority the author puts on each of these, in order to recognize the author’s most important concern.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The habit of relying on the opinions of others
<br>
Incorrect. This is not mentioned in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: An inability to appreciate one’s own complexity
<br>
Correct. "If [people] cannot attribute scope and depth and complexity to others, moreover, it is unlikely that they will perceive these dimensions in themselves" (paragraph 6); that the author considers this the “ultimate effect” of gossip is supported by its placement in the penultimate paragraph and its elaboration in the final, concluding paragraph. Further, this is a broad, sweeping moral condemnation—the author’s claim that those who gossip will fail to understand themselves and their motives—and is not an obvious or local consequence of such behavior.
<br><br>
Option C: A tendency to trivialize the motives of others
<br>
Incorrect. The author identifies as a consequence of gossip the inability to think of other human beings "in other than trivial ways" (paragraph 6), which is not the same as—or limited to--trivializing the motives of others.
<br><br>
Option D: The ready acceptance of group stereotypes
<br>
Incorrect. The author says that gossip can be "the vehicle for stereotypes" (paragraph 6), but does not say, or imply, that its “ultimate effect” is the ready acceptance of such stereotypes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 65</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: find intrinsic satisfaction in discerning the truth about others.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to read closely a claim made by the author to identify an assumption that is implicit in that claim—an assumption that the author implicitly signals, in other words.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: are concerned with helping others to understand and to deal with their problems.
<br>
Incorrect. The closest the author comes to assuming this is the reference to using information "at times" (paragraph 2) in order "to warn" (paragraph 2); it is certainly not implicit in the reference to a desire for knowledge, since so many other uses of knowledge are mentioned in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: take secret pleasure in discussing the weaknesses and failures of others.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: want to use inside information to excel over and to manipulate others.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not imply such specifically selfish motives to those who gossip.
<br><br>
Option D: find intrinsic satisfaction in discerning the truth about others.
<br>
Correct. This is supported by the claim that we do have a desire for knowledge that leads us to "go beneath the surface of what is said and shown and to try to unravel conflicting clues and seemingly false leads" (first paragraph), along with the claim that "If we knew about people only what they wished to reveal…we would be deprived of <i>the pleasure</i>…that comes from trying to understand them" (paragraph 2). The first quotation supports the assumption that the desire is intrinsic, and the second supports the suggestion that it is satisfying.
