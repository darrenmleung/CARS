# Passage 15
One of the curious notions that citizens of the United States have about their presidency is that it ought to function with the kind of authority over the policy process that a prime ministry has in a parliamentary system. True, Congress now awaits the president’s proposals, for the president has the task of establishing a legislative agenda and setting its priorities. But the image of the U.S. president as a powerful chief legislator is an illusion.

The leading source of the exaggerated image of presidential policymaking power is a tendency to overemphasize the personal contribution of past presidents to sweeping policy changes. Americans want their president to function in the same way as a prime minister in a collectively responsible parliamentary government, but the president possesses neither the constitutional authority nor sufficient resources to make government function efficiently or with accountability.

In a parliamentary system, responsible government means a fusion of the executive and legislative powers rather than a separation. It requires the government leaders—a prime minister and other cabinet ministers—to present a united front to the legislature. And if the legislature refuses to support the government on important policy matters, a prime minister can either immediately dissolve the parliament or resign along with the rest of the cabinet, necessitating a new election, which could jeopardize the political careers of some members of the parliament. Such a system maintains important channels of communication between those who govern and those who are governed, for it emphasizes leadership, party, loyalty, and accountability between the legislature and the ministry, or executive branch.

U.S. presidents are often exasperated by an inability to get legislation through Congress, even when the president’s own party controls a substantial majority. A congressional expert recently commented, “We have never had sustained congressional-presidential unity for even one full term.” A president’s leadership over national policymaking is fraught with uncertainty and stymied by delays and rejections because no other presidential task is as vulnerable to the wishes or whims of so many others.

Basic changes in the way Congress functions as well as in the outlook of its newer members toward their institution and their constituencies have made Congress less amenable to persuasion. In recent years, the gap between the promise of legislative leadership and what can realistically be achieved grew even wider. Presidential misjudgments, as in the Vietnam intervention, prompted action by Congress against the president’s foreign-policy authority, and the domestic-policy environment has since grown increasingly hostile to direction. A decline of political party influence has contributed to a dispersion of power within Congress, making it more difficult for presidents to work through party leaders to develop and steer a legislative agenda through the Senate and House.

The role of the federal government itself has changed dramatically as the U.S. has faced declining prosperity at home and a dwindling monopoly over economic and military powers abroad. Demands for new programs oppose pressures to hold the line on governmental spending. Suspicion in the aftermath of repeated ethical scandals involving presidents has led to increased congressional surveillance of the White House.

The belief that particular presidents have achieved remarkable results in policy leadership fits neatly with a national need to see the presidency as an exceptional role. But it clashes with the real world of national politics. Strong presidential leadership is the exception rather than the rule, and conflict between the two branches is as American as apple pie.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 82</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: policy changes are associated with the president in office at the time.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that tests your understanding of basic components of the text; the answer is a paraphrase of a point that the author makes explicitly in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: policy changes are associated with the president in office at the time.
<br>
Correct. The passage says: "The leading source of the exaggerated image of presidential policymaking power is a tendency to overemphasize the personal contribution of past presidents to sweeping policy changes" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option B: congresses dominated by the president’s party will support presidential policies.
<br>
Incorrect. The author argues the opposite of this: “A decline of political party influence has contributed to a dispersion of power within Congress, making it more difficult for presidents to work through party leaders to develop and steer a legislative agenda through the Senate and House” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: the public depends on the president to control the excesses of Congress.
<br>
Incorrect. The author never suggests that this is the case.
<br><br>
Option D: the U.S. legislative system is based on a parliamentary model.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is contradicted by the passage, which indicates that the U. S. system is <i>not</i> based on a parliamentary model: "Americans want their president to function in the same way as a prime minister in a collectively responsible parliamentary government, but…" (paragraph 2).

  <summary>Question 83</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: As a reason for an increase in congressional mistrust of the president

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it provides you with information that is not contained in the passage and asks you to consider how such information would affect, or “relate” to the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: As a response to the distorted public image of the presidency
<br>
Incorrect. The author suggests that the public perception of the presidency is distorted because the public overestimates presidential power. It does not make sense to consider the Watergate break-in as a “response” to this distorted public perception of presidential power.
<br><br>
Option B: As an example of the inability of presidents to control events
<br>
Incorrect. When the author talks about limited presidential control, it is in reference to a lack of control over a legislative agenda. The example of the Watergate break-in given in the stem does not offer an example of what the author discusses.
<br><br>
Option C: As evidence of the contrast between a president and a prime minister
<br>
Incorrect. There is nothing in the passage about prime ministers compared to presidents that would bear on the mentioned investigation.
<br><br>
Option D: As a reason for an increase in congressional mistrust of the president
<br>
Correct. The author says "Suspicion in the aftermath of repeated ethical scandals involving presidents has led to increased congressional surveillance of the White House" (paragraph 6). Because Watergate was an ethical scandal involving a president, it would be reasonable for the author to say it would be a reason for increased surveillance of the president, indicating increased mistrust.

  <summary>Question 84</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Cabinet ministers will vote in the same way as the prime minister.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to predict a reasonable assumption based on the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Legislators will try to advance their careers by opposing the prime minister.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that the opposite is true: "If the legislature refuses to support the government on important policy matters, a prime minister can…dissolve the parliament…which could jeopardize the political careers of some members of the parliament" (paragraph 3); the author continues: "Such a system [a parliamentary system]…emphasizes…loyalty…" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: Cabinet ministers will vote in the same way as the prime minister.
<br>
Correct. The passage clearly supports this option: "[A parliamentary system] requires the government leaders—a prime minister and other cabinet ministers—to present a united front to the legislature" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option C: Parliamentary leaders will offer to resign if their proposals are outvoted.
<br>
Incorrect. The author explains about a parliamentary system: “if the legislature refuses to support the government on important policy matters, a prime minister can either immediately dissolve the parliament or resign along with the rest of the cabinet, necessitating a new election” (paragraph 3). This is not the same as saying that Parliamentary leaders will <i>offer to resign</i> in this circumstance, nor does the author say that resignations are the most likely outcome when a legislature does not support the government.
<br><br>
Option D: Parliaments will be dissolved if a prime minister is involved in a scandal.
<br>
Incorrect. The only mention of parliaments being dissolved is in the case of the legislature refusing "to support the government on important policy matters" (paragraph 3); there is no mention of scandal in relation to parliamentary governments.

  <summary>Question 85</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: attempting to guide students during open discussions.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply passage information to a hypothetical scenario outside of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: impressing students with an authoritative manner.
<br>
Incorrect. The author contends that citizens overestimate their president's authority: “The leading source of the exaggerated image of presidential policymaking power is a tendency to overemphasize the personal contribution of past presidents to sweeping policy changes" (paragraph 2). And, in any case, the passage talks of "constitutional authority" (paragraph 2) rather than "an authoritative manner.”
<br><br>
Option B: having a clear syllabus that is closely followed.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says: "the president has the task of establishing a legislative agenda and setting its priorities" (first paragraph), but "the president possesses neither the constitutional authority nor sufficient resources to make government function efficiently" (paragraph 2). This clearly suggests that the agenda is not necessarily "closely followed." The agenda not being “closely followed” is further supported later in the passage: "A decline of political party influence [has made it] more difficult for presidents to…steer a legislative agenda through the Senate and House" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: delegating classroom authority to teaching assistants.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage maintains that the president steers a legislative agenda through the Senate and House by <i>working with</i> party leaders (paragraph 5), not by delegating authority to them.
<br><br>
Option D: attempting to guide students during open discussions.
<br>
Correct. This is supported by the author’s claim that the president tries (albeit with the prospect of difficulty and failure) "to develop and steer a legislative agenda through the Senate and House" (paragraph 5).

  <summary>Question 86</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: Voting in Congress is increasingly independent of party agendas.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider situations that are not part of the passage and to assess how these would affect (and in this case, support) the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Corruption among White House officials is increasingly widespread.
<br>
Incorrect. Even if corruption in the White House was “increasingly widespread,” this would not provide direct evidence for “changes” in the government, in the terms the passage is most concerned with—which have to do with congressional support for the President.
<br><br>
Option B: World leaders are increasingly opposed to U.S. foreign policy decisions.
<br>
  Incorrect. The passage says that <i>Congress</i>, not world leaders opposed the president's foreign-policy authority (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: The media are giving proposed legislation increasingly critical attention.
<br>
Incorrect. Increased media scrutiny does not necessarily provide support for the kind of changes the passage emphasizes, in terms of decreased party cohesion.
<br><br>
Option D: Voting in Congress is increasingly independent of party agendas.
<br>
Correct. The passage says that "A decline of political party influence has contributed to a dispersion of power within Congress…" (paragraph 5). This option, then, shows clear support for the kind of changes in the U.S. government that are described in the passage.
