# Passage 1
Many theorists have speculated on the relationship between technology and the expansion of literature. One group views social change as the catalyst for both technological and literary developments; another argues that technology leads the evolution of both society and literature. A frequently cited example of the literature-technology relationship is the advent of the novel, perhaps the only literary genre that is unequivocally a product of the medium of print.

Yet Watt’s account of the rise of the novel stresses not technological change but the growth of a reading public as fundamental to the eighteenth-century literary innovation. Similarly, when considering the expansion of literacy a century later, James refuses to attribute it to technological transformations but appears to see the two phenomena as independent determinants of the growth of certain types of literary product.

Altick takes the relationship further: “Everybody knows that in the nineteenth century the number of English readers, and therefore the productions of the press, multiplied spectacularly.” That is, Altick seems to see such technological innovations as the high-speed printing press, techniques for the reproduction of photographs and illustrations, and typesetting machines for newspapers as a response to the demand of the reading public.

Febvre and Martin, too, in considering the rise of the book, point out that a new reading public preceded the invention of the printing press. From the late thirteenth century, they say, the new bourgeois class, particularly lawyers and merchants, constituted such a public, requiring faster methods of reproducing written works than those of scribes and illuminators. Febvre and Martin’s emphasis on the relatively autonomous development of printing and the spread of reading indicates a refusal to collapse the history of the book into either technological or social determinism. Typical of their views is this statement: “All things considered, the work of copyists and scriveners paved the way for the printers. On the eve of the appearance of the first printed texts, a growing demand for books was obvious, particularly among the emergent social classes.”

In considering the development of television, Williams also opposes the idea of technological determinism: “It is especially a characteristic of the communications systems that all were foreseen . . . before the crucial components of the developed systems had been discovered.” In no way did the new medium create new social conditions. The decisive transformation of industrial production, with its new social forms, which had emerged from a long period of capital accumulation, created new needs along with new possibilities, and the communications revolution, including television, was its outcome.

In her discussion of the influence of the printing press, Eisenstein considers another aspect of the interplay between technology and society: “Yet the fact remains that once presses were established in numerous European towns, the transforming powers of print did begin to take effect. The new shops themselves interacted with the urbanites who received them in a manner that produced occupational mutations and intellectual regroupment. Here again, one may agree that even when acting as agents of change, early printers could be effective only in combination with other forces.”

One undeniable truth is that technological and scientific discoveries never take place in a social vacuum. They may not be intended to meet a social need in an obvious and direct manner, and they may indeed be the cause of important and far-reaching social transformations. But there is every likelihood that scientific inquiry is directed in complex ways by social issues and the needs of those in positions of power.

  <summary>Question 1</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: literature changed in response to a complex combination of social and technological factors.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to recognize from contextual cues and argument the author’s position on the complex topic covered in the passage—the role of technology in the emergence of literature. Although the author articulates a position in the final paragraph, you must also integrate contextual information from elsewhere in the passage in order to locate the author’s position.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: literature changed in response to a complex combination of social and technological factors.
<br>
Correct. The author's position is conveyed in the final paragraph: "One undeniable truth is that technological and scientific discoveries [described in the first paragraph as including the technology, such as the high-speed printing press, that enabled the initial burgeoning of the novel] never take place in a social vacuum (final paragraph); the author goes on: "…there is every likelihood that scientific inquiry is directed in complex ways by social issues…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option B: some changes in literature resulted from social factors, others from technological factors.
<br>
Incorrect. The author describes social and technological changes in the final paragraph as essentially interdependent; he or she does not endorse the idea that some literary changes result from social change, others from technology. “[Technological changes] may not be intended to meet a social need in an obvious and direct manner, and they may indeed be the cause of important and far-reaching social transformations. But there is every likelihood that scientific inquiry is directed in complex ways by social issues…” (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: the disagreement of experts on the determinants of literary changes leaves the issue open.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author describes in the first paragraph differing views on the “relationship between technology and the expansion of literature,” he or she does not actually leave the question “open.” Most of the critics she discusses “oppose technological determinism” (paragraph 5), and the author says "One undeniable truth is that technological and scientific discoveries never take place in a social vacuum" (final paragraph, emphasis added).
<br><br>
Option D: an emphasis on social and technological changes has caused developments within literature to be overlooked.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not suggest that excessive attention to social and technological change has caused literary developments to be “overlooked” by critics.

<details>
  <summary>Question 2</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: The expansion of industry and commerce produced a new class with education and leisure.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to examine options that describe circumstances not discussed in the passage to assess which of these options would most strongly support a passage assertion. This question, then, also gives you practice in a skill tested in Reasoning Within the Text questions, because it also asks you to assess which option provides evidentiary support for a passage claim.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The novel was a means of exploring the increasing conflict between social classes.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is incorrect because it describes a topic or theme within novels (the “increasing conflict between social classes”) but does not address the rise of a reading public and thus does not offer support for Watt’s position.
<br><br>
Option B: With the decline of patronage in the arts, writers had increasing freedom to choose their topics.
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes the increasing freedom of eighteenth-century authors to write about a range of topics, rather than worrying about whether their writing would please their patrons. The option does not address the rise of a reading public, and thus does not support Watt’s position, as it is described in the stem.
<br><br>
Option C: The expansion of industry and commerce produced a new class with education and leisure.
<br>
Correct. The author describes Watt’s position in the first sentence of paragraph 2: “Watt’s account of the rise of the novel stresses not technological change, but the growth of a reading public as fundamental to the eighteenth-century literary innovation.” This option is correct, because it describes precisely the conditions that produced a larger reading public: “the expansion of industry and commerce produced a new class with education and leisure.” Thus, this option clearly supports Watt’s explanation for the rise of the novel.
<br><br>
Option D: Many forms of art flourished and interacted in ways seemingly independent of social changes.
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes “many forms of art” operating “independent of social changes.” Watt’s argument de-emphasizes technological change, not social change. This option therefore does not support Watt’s claim.

<details>
  <summary>Question 3</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: II only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider scenarios not discussed in the passage, and compare these to the passage argument, to assess whether these scenarios are consistent or inconsistent with the passage argument.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: II only
<br>
Correct. This scenario describes a kind of “technological determinism” (paragraph 4), in which a technological change (the development of high-speed printing presses) spurs social change, such as educational reforms, as well as cultural change. The author argues in the passage against this kind of direct development of social change emerging from technological change, and thus this option (II only) is inconsistent with the passage argument.
<br><br>
Option B: III only
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes a scenario consistent with the passage argument. The passage argument is that technological change never “takes place in a social vacuum,” and that technological changes are often responses to “social needs” (final paragraph). This scenario is an example of a social change (“wealth concentrated in urban centers”) spurring other social change (demand for literature), as well as technological change. Thus, this scenario is consistent with the passage argument.
<br><br>
Option C: I and II only
<br>
Incorrect. Although Option II describes a scenario inconsistent with the passage argument and so is correct, Option I is incorrect. The author describes technological innovations as often a response to “social needs” (final paragraph) and cites Altick’s claim that "technological innovations such as the high-speed printing press … [were] a response to the demand of the reading public" (paragraph 3). The scenario described in Option I is consistent with the passage argument, as it describes a social factor motivating a technological change as well as another social development.
<br><br>
Option D: I and III only
<br>
Incorrect. Both options I and III are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with the passage argument.

  <summary>Question 4</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: The access of the public to new technologies determines the direction of social change.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to determine the meaning of a term used in the passage from the context of its use in two different paragraphs.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The technological sophistication of a population determines their reception of revolutionary inventions.
<br>
Incorrect. The author never implies that “technological sophistication" determines the receptivity to new inventions, nor is the term “technological determinism” used to imply this belief.
<br><br>
Option B: The social structure of a culture determines the technological advances of which it is capable.
<br>
Incorrect. The author defines “technological determinism” when he paraphrases Williams' claim: "In no way did the new medium create new social conditions" (paragraph 5). This option is therefore incorrect because it describes, in effect, the opposite of technological determinism, indicating that social conditions determine or cause technological advances.
<br><br>
Option C: The demand for technological innovations determines the type of research that is undertaken.
<br>
Incorrect. C is incorrect because neither Williams nor Eisenstein suggest that demand for technological innovation determines the type of research that is undertaken. (The author mentions "scientific inquiry" in the last paragraph, but its mention there is not relevant to the implied meaning of technological determinism.)
<br><br>
Option D: The access of the public to new technologies determines the direction of social change.
<br>
Correct. The passage says that Williams opposes the idea of technological determinism (paragraph 5), elaborating: "In no way did the new medium [television} create new social conditions" (paragraph 5); this implies that the term indicates a causal connection whereby technology determines or produces new social condition. The author also invokes the term in paragraph 4: “Febvre and Martin’s emphasis on the relatively autonomous development of printing and the spread of reading indicates a refusal to collapse the history of the book into either technological or social determinism.” This again implies that the term suggests a tight causal link in which technology causes (or “determines”) social circumstances.

  <summary>Question 5</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Social changes established a need for TV, and its development has contributed to further changes.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it begins with a statement not discussed in the passage and asks you to predict, based on passage arguments, how the author would respond to this statement.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Changes in society’s values led to technical refinement of TV and ensured its rapid acceptance.
<br>
Incorrect. This option describes a kind of social determinism, in which social changes or needs unidirectionally produce technological developments. The author describes a more nuanced and interactive relationship between social and technological change than is described in this option.
<br><br>
Option B: Social changes established a need for TV, and its development has contributed to further changes.
<br>
Correct. This option is the closest to the way the author characterizes the development of television as well as to the way in which the author discusses the interaction between technology and social change more broadly: “In no way did the new medium [television] create new social conditions. The decisive transformation of industrial production, with its new social forms, which had emerged from a long period of capital accumulation, created new needs along with new possibilities, and the communications revolution, including television, was its outcome” (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option C: TV created a demand for information and for new technologies that have accelerated social changes.
<br>
Incorrect. This scenario, in which technology creates social conditions on its own, is an instance of the “technological determinism,” which the author implies in paragraphs 4 and 5 are too simplistic to accurately characterize the relationship of technological and social change. In the final paragraph, the author makes more explicit his or her vision of a mutually reinforcing relationship between the two factors.
<br><br>
Option D: Later advances in communication technology have reduced the relative social significance of TV.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not discuss a technological development causing a social change in this way, so this option is not supported.

<details>
  <summary>Question 6</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: It supports the idea that technology does not determine the form taken by literature.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, which presents a scenario that is not discussed in the passage and asks how this scenario would affect passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It supports the idea that economic factors are irrelevant to technological developments.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not discuss this idea.
<br><br>
Option B: It supports the idea that technology does not determine the form taken by literature.
<br>
Correct. The scenario discussed in the question describes a situation in which technological change does not alter or transform literary production. This is consistent with the author’s resistance to “technological determinism” throughout the passage. One instance of this is the author’s citation of James’s claims that technological transformations are independent of the development of the novel (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option C: It weakens the idea that literacy is necessary for the existence of a market for literature.
<br>
Incorrect. The fact that these recorded stories retained the “style of traditional oral stories” does not weaken the claim that literacy was a critical factor in creating a market for printed texts (as discussed in paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option D: It weakens the idea that new technologies are responses to demands by the public.
<br>
Incorrect. Although Altick presents this idea in paragraph 3 ("technological innovations [are] a response to the demand of the reading public"), the given information does not weaken this idea in any way.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Question 7</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: No; the results mentioned have no clear correspondence to specific historical events.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, which asks you to evaluate the evidence for a conclusion to see if that conclusion is effectively supported. This question also asks you to consider the nature of the evidence, as you assess whether the evidence is “verifiable”—in other words, whether the claims behind the evidence can be proven.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Yes; printing presses were clearly catalysts for further technological and literary developments.
<br>
Incorrect. Eisenstein links printing presses to shops to occupational and intellectual changes, not to "further technological and literary developments" (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option B: Yes; the advent of the novel was clearly a direct result of the capabilities of printing.
<br>
Incorrect. Eisenstein does not provide evidence of this.
<br><br>
Option C: No; the output of printing shops clearly did not have major occupational and intellectual effects.
<br>
Incorrect. Eisenstein makes the opposite claim: "The new shops … interacted with the urbanites who received them in a manner that produced occupational mutations and intellectual regroupment" (paragraph 6).
<br><br>
Option D: No; the results mentioned have no clear correspondence to specific historical events.
<br>
Correct. Eisenstein says that the effect of printing was, via the new shops, "occupational mutations and intellectual regroupment" (paragraph 6), but there is no verifiable evidence of this in the passage. Eisenstein concludes that "early printers could be effective <i>only in combination</i> with other forces" (paragraph 6); similarly, there is no verifiable evidence of this in the passage.
