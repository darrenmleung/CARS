# Passage 17
Alexis de Tocqueville wrote of the U.S. people in 1831 that when all "are nearly alike, and all follow the same track, it is very difficult for any one individual to walk quick and cleave a way through the same throng which surrounds and presses." Yet cleaving a way is precisely the goal of Americans. Even as modern America celebrates mass culture, conformity, and popularity, it also lures its citizens to rise above the crowd, to be unique.

"This land is your land, and this land is my land," Woody Guthrie's populist anthem tells Americans, but Americans keep trying to increase the "my" at the expense of the "your." Instead of fostering contentment with the unprecedented prosperity achievable by ordinary citizens, "the American dream" breeds desire. Unlike Europe, where generations of social immobility created aristocratic classes with accents and physical traits that distinguished them from the masses, America has no native signals to instantly communicate status. So precisely because the U.S. is a democratic nation, the demand for elitist goods is particularly strong among its citizens.

For the semiotician, the paradoxical nature of the U.S. myth of equality is especially clear in the images that U.S. advertisers use to manipulate the public. Persuasion is not attempted; U.S. advertisements are not sources of product information but exercises in behavior modification. Appealing to subconscious emotions rather than to the intellect, advertising campaigns are designed to exploit the discontent induced by the dream. Since a consumer economy runs on desire, advertising transforms common objects, whether peanut butter, gym shoes, or political candidates, into symbols of the coveted status. The object itself doesn't really matter; what matters is the signal it sends about its owner.

While advertisements serve fantasies about everything from rock stars to robots, they also play on darker imaginings. If hope can be exploited for sales, so can dread. The nightmare counterpart of the wish for approval is the fear of rejection. Parodying ancient rituals of religious transgression and atonement, guilt ads characteristically create narrative situations in which someone is accused of some social crime, pronounced guilty, then offered the sponsor's product as a means of regaining innocence. In such commercials, a product takes the place of spiritual regeneration, but the promise of salvation is similar.

Commercials for pharmaceutical, grooming, and cleaning products that bully the insecure are still around, but they were especially common in the 1950s, reflecting a people reeling from the anti-Communist frenzy of a paranoid time. When any intellectual distinction or social eccentricity could result in public denunciation, citizens were keen to conform. Nobody wanted to be "guilty" of smelling sweaty or of having a soiled collar.

If guilt looks backward to past transgressions, fear, like desire, faces forward, trembling before the future. In the late 1980s, a new kind of story line appeared. Representing the nightmare equivalent of the desire to "arrive," its images were of failure and defeat. Executives miss deadlines because they lack the sponsor's desktop publishing system. A pleasant old man confides the fear he had of being unable to pay medical bills before he acquired security with his supplemental health insurance. Among all the fears advertisers exploit, that of not having a posh enough burial site is perhaps the most arresting. But whatever the object touted, by reading the signals that advertisers send to stimulate its consumption, we can plot the state of desire and anxiety in the audiences they address.

  <summary>Question 94</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: It is most effective in a dissatisfied society.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is Comprehension question because it asks you to identify the option that is closest to the author’s point of view about advertising, as expressed in the passage. To answer this question, you need to be able to take from the passage the author’s key ideas and compare them to the paraphrases presented in the options.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It subverts democracy by promoting unfair competition.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage implies that democracy enables or promotes the desire that fosters advertising: "So precisely because the U. S. is a democratic nation, the demand for elitist goods is particularly strong among its citizens" (paragraph 2), not that advertising <i>subverts</i> democracy.
<br><br>
Option B: It thrives under conditions of capitalist prosperity.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage implies that advertising thrives not so much because of prosperity, but because of desire: "Instead of fostering contentment with the unprecedented prosperity achievable by ordinary citizens, 'the American dream' breeds desire.…So…the demand for elitist goods is particularly strong among its citizens" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option C: It would not be manipulative in a socialist nation.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no information in the passage to support this option.
<br><br>
Option D: It is most effective in a dissatisfied society.
<br>
Correct. The author writes explicitly that “advertising campaigns are designed to exploit the discontent induced by the dream” (paragraph 3).

  <summary>Question 95</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: an inaccurate anthem for the American dream.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to infer the author’s perspective about Guthrie’s song from the way the author presents the song.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: an inaccurate anthem for the American dream.
<br>
Correct. "'This land is your land, and this land is my land,' Woody Guthrie's populist anthem tells Americans, but Americans keep trying to increase the 'my' at the expense of the 'your'. Instead of fostering contentment with the unprecedented prosperity achievable by ordinary citizens, 'the American dream' breeds desire" (paragraph 2). The author implies that Guthrie’s song advocates a kind of communal spirit, and that while the “American dream” could potentially describe a satisfaction with the possibilities the nation is supposed to afford, Americans really seek to maximize their own personal “success.” Guthrie’s anthem, then, does not capture what the author sees as the true spirit of the American dream.
<br><br>
Option B: a clever parody of the American dream.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not suggest that Guthrie’s “populist anthem” is a parody; there is no reason to assume that the author does not see the song as sincere.
<br><br>
Option C: influenced by U.S. advertising campaigns.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no indication in the passage that the author believes this.
<br><br>
Option D: a response to de Tocqueville's criticism.
<br>
Incorrect. De Tocqueville's comment is about the difficulty of achieving individuality in the U.S.; Guthrie's song—or at least the single line that is quoted—doesn't address that at all.

  <summary>Question 96</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: opposing desires, for superiority and for acceptance.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, because it asks you to infer from the author’s statements the causal chain the author suggests.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a society controlled by professional manipulators.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author describes advertisers as seeking to “manipulate the public” (paragraph 3), the passage does not say that U.S. society is “controlled by professional manipulators.” This is too broad and sweeping an inference to make based on the author’s words.
<br><br>
Option B: opposing desires, for superiority and for acceptance.
<br>
  Correct. The author writes: "…the <i>paradoxical</i> nature of the U. S. myth of equality is especially clear…" (paragraph 3). The desire for superiority is conveyed by "the demand for elitist goods" (paragraph 2) and the desire for acceptance by the celebration of "mass culture, conformity, and popularity" (first paragraph).
<br><br>
Option C: vulnerability to parodies of religious rituals.
<br>
Incorrect. The author describes "guilt ads" as "parodying ancient rituals of religious transgression and atonement" (paragraph 4), but it is the fear of rejection which leads to our vulnerability to such ads, in the author’s view, not the myth of equality.
<br><br>
Option D: the anti-Communist paranoia of the 1950s.
<br>
Incorrect. The author mentions the "Anti-Communist frenzy of a paranoid time" (paragraph 5) as relevant to advertising strategies in the 1950s because "citizens were keen to conform" (paragraph 5), not because of the myth of equality.

  <summary>Question 97</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: conformity is a sign of innocence.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify what the author says or implies about a particular historical circumstance mentioned in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: moral superiority is rewarded by material success.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this; moral superiority is not implicated at all.
<br><br>
Option B: eccentricity indicates immoral tendencies.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this; the author merely says that "social eccentricity could result in public denunciation" (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
  Option C: the American dream is <i>universally</i> desired.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no indication that the American dream is universally desired, or that this is the myth that the author associates with Anti-Communism.
<br><br>
Option D: conformity is a sign of innocence.
<br>
Correct. The author contends that: “Parodying ancient rituals of religious transgression and atonement, guilt ads characteristically create narrative situations in which someone is accused of some social crime, pronounced guilty, then <i>offered the sponsor's product as a means of regaining innocence.</i>” (paragraph 4, emphasis added). The author goes on to argue that advertisements “that bully the insecure…were especially common in the 1950s, reflecting a people reeling from the anti-Communist frenzy of a paranoid time. <i>When any intellectual distinction or social eccentricity could result in public denunciation, citizens were keen to conform</i>. Nobody wanted to be "guilty" of smelling sweaty or of having a soiled collar” (paragraph 5, emphasis added).

  <summary>Question 98</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: is mistakenly associated with contentment.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a basic Comprehension question because it asks you to locate the author’s explicitly stated viewpoint about a topic discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: is mistakenly associated with contentment.
<br>
Correct. "Instead of fostering contentment…'the American dream' breeds desire" (paragraph 2); since it breeds desire, any association with contentment is mistaken.
<br><br>
Option B: was healthy in de Tocqueville's time.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not supported in the passage; de Tocqueville merely says that when everyone is the same, it is hard to be unique.
<br><br>
Option C: was created to sell consumer goods.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage implies that advertising consumer goods capitalizes on the American dream, not that the American dream was <i>created</i> to sell consumer goods.
<br><br>
Option D: is cynically hypocritical.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported in the passage.

<details>
  <summary>Question 99</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: To indicate a particular interest in analyzing the symbolic content of advertisements

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the author’s likely reason for making a particular reference; it asks you to consider how this reference illuminates something about the author’s interest or approach in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: To indicate a particular interest in analyzing the symbolic content of advertisements
<br>
Correct. The author writes, "For the semiotician, the paradoxical nature of the U. S. myth of equality is especially clear in the images that U. S. advertisers use to manipulate the public…advertising transforms common objects…into symbols…" (paragraph 3). These specific references, along with the interest throughout the passage in the symbolic content of advertisements (as appealing to “fantasies,” “nightmares,” and “rituals” (paragraph 4), for instance, make this option correct.
<br><br>
Option B: To remind readers that the U.S. people have no conventional signs to indicate status
<br>
Incorrect. This is mentioned in paragraph 2 independently of the reference to semioticians.
<br><br>
Option C: To give credit to the profession most concerned with revealing logical paradoxes
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not credit semioticians with revealing logical paradoxes.
<br><br>
Option D: To identify the group to whom the passage is addressed
<br>
Incorrect. It is very unlikely that the author is addressing the passage primarily to a group as narrow as semioticians: all but paragraph 3 address American citizens subject to advertising (or simply those interested in American advertising and/or the American Dream).
