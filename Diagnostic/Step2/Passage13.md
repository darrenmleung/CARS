# Passage 13
The new kind of synthetic novelty that has flooded people's experience I will call _pseudo-events_. The prefix _pseudo_ comes from the Greek word meaning false or intended to deceive. Before I recall the historical forces that have made pseudo-events possible, have increased the supply of them and the demand for them, I will give a commonplace example.

The owners of a hotel consult a public relations counselor. They ask in what way they might increase their hotel's prestige and so improve their business. In less sophisticated times, the answer might have been to hire a new chef, to improve the plumbing, to paint the rooms, or to install a crystal chandelier in the lobby. The public relations counselor's technique is more indirect: a recommendation that the management stage a celebration of the hotel's thirtieth anniversary. A committee is formed, including a prominent banker, a well known lawyer, and an influential preacher. The celebration is held, photographs are taken, the occasion is widely reported, and the object is accomplished.

The power to make a reportable event is thus the power to make experience. One is reminded of Napoleon's apocryphal reply to his general who objected that circumstances were unfavorable to a proposed campaign: "Bah, I make circumstances!" The modern public relations counselor—only one of many twentieth-century creators of pseudo-events—has come close to fulfilling Napoleon's idle boast. The intriguing feature of the modern situation, however, comes precisely from the fact that the modern news makers are not gods. The news they make happen, the events they create, are somehow not quite real.

A pseudo-event is not spontaneous but comes about because someone has planned, planted, or incited it. Typically, it is not a train wreck or an earthquake but an interview. It is planned primarily (not always exclusively) for the immediate purpose of being reported or reproduced. Therefore, its occurrence is arranged for the convenience of the reporting or reproducing media. Its success is measured by the extent to which it is publicized. Time relations in it are commonly fictitious or factitious; the announcement is given out in advance "for future release" and written as if the event had occurred in the past. The question "Is it real?" is less important than "Is it newsworthy?"

Its relation to the underlying reality of the situation is ambiguous. Its interest arises largely from this very ambiguity. Concerning a pseudo-event, the question "What does it mean?" has a new dimension. While the news interest in a train wreck is in _what_ happened and in the real consequences, the interest in an interview is always, in a sense, in _whether_ something happened and in what might have been the interviewee's motives. Did the statement really mean what it said? Without some of this ambiguity, a pseudo-event cannot be very interesting. Usually it is intended to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The hotel's thirtieth-anniversary celebration, by saying that the hotel is a distinguished institution, actually makes it one.

In the last half century, a larger and larger proportion of popular experience, of what people read and see and hear, has come to consist of pseudo-events. People expect more of them and are given more of them. A full explanation of the origin and rise of pseudo-events would be nothing less than a history of modern America.

# Answers
<details>
  <summary>Question 72</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: certainty.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it tests your understanding of the author’s explicit characterization of a central term used in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: seriousness.
<br>
Incorrect. The example of a pseudo-event (the hotel wanting to increase its prestige and business) is relatively serious.
<br><br>
Option B: interest.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says, speaking of a pseudo-event, "Its interest arises largely from…" (paragraph 5), suggesting that it <i>does</i> have interest.
<br><br>
Option C: certainty.
<br>
Correct. The passage says: "the interest in an interview [which is given as an example of a pseudo-event in paragraph 4] is always, in a sense, in <i>whether</i> something happened…" (paragraph 5), thus indicating a lack of certainty.
<br><br>
Option D: results.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage says, speaking of a pseudo-event, "its success is measured by the extent to which it is publicized" (paragraph 4); to the extent that “success” refers to “results,” this means that there are results.

  <summary>Question 73</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: to clarify the nature of pseudo-events.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to determine the author’s purpose in the passage as a whole, which is not stated explicitly. To determine the author’s purpose, you have to integrate cues given at different points in the passage and extrapolate from the way that the author discusses the topic to establish the author’s primary concerns.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: to trace the history of pseudo-events.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says in the final sentence of the passage: "A full explanation of <i>the origin and rise of pseudo-events</i> would be nothing less than a history of modern America," implying that such an explanation has not been given in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: to explain the variety of pseudo-events.
<br>
Incorrect. No variety is presented in the passage: there is one example in paragraph 2, and then discussion of "an interview" in paragraphs 4-5.
<br><br>
Option C: to analyze the effects of pseudo-events.
<br>
Incorrect. Effects are actually not mentioned in the passage apart from "being reported or reproduced" (paragraph 4), which are actually presented as purpose rather than effect.
<br><br>
Option D: to clarify the nature of pseudo-events.
<br>
Correct. The nature of pseudo-events is clarified with a detailed example (paragraph 2) and the author then devotes all of paragraphs 4 and 5 to a discussion of the features that distinguish or characterize “pseudo-events.” For instance, the author writes in paragraph 4: “A pseudo-event is not spontaneous but comes about because someone has planned, planted, or incited it. Typically, it is not a train wreck or an earthquake but an interview. It is planned primarily…(not always exclusively) for the immediate purpose of being reported or reproduced.” Although the author does not state explicitly that “clarifying the nature” of the events is his or her primary concern, this detailed enumeration of what a pseudo-event is and is not directs you to the correct answer.

  <summary>Question 74</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: I only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it begins from an example that is discussed in the passage and asks you to apply passage arguments to predict an outcome not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: I only
<br>
Correct. Option I describes a scenario that would not have been welcome because the organizers were trying to "increase their hotel's prestige and so improve their business" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option B: II only
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that announcements are given out in advance “for future release” (paragraph 4), so if the reports occurred a week after the event, that would likely have been acceptable. Thus, II is incorrect.
<br><br>
Option C: I and III only
<br>
Incorrect. Although I is correct, III is not: since the purpose of the pseudo-event was to improve business (paragraph 2), surely the exaggeration of the quality of service would have pleased the organizers.
<br><br>
Option D: II and III only
<br>
Incorrect. Neither II nor III is correct.

  <summary>Question 75</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: are responsive to a popular appetite for such stories.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which tests your understanding of a point made by the author and that requires you to identify the answer as essentially a paraphrase of a passage claim.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: cannot distinguish a planted story from an authentic one.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not say anything about the ability of the media to judge the story’s origin.
<br><br>
Option B: are responsive to a popular appetite for such stories.
<br>
Correct. The author says "People expect more of them [pseudo-events] and are given more of them" (final paragraph), which supports this option.
<br><br>
Option C: lack standards for judging the newsworthiness of stories.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not criticize the media for a lack of “standards.”
<br><br>
Option D: want to curry favor with influential persons.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.

<details>
  <summary>Question 76</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: a police officer who has just witnessed a spectacular disaster.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to use passage arguments to evaluate the effect on the author’s argument of hypothetical scenarios that are not discussed in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a police officer who has just witnessed a spectacular disaster.
<br>
  Correct. This option describes an interview that is <i>not</i> planned in advance for publicity (paragraph 4) and that <i>does</i> answer the question: “What happened?” (paragraph 5); both elements are counter to those cited by the author in the author’s indictment of interviews.
<br><br>
Option B: a young athlete who is expected to win a major competition.
<br>
Incorrect. This interview occurs prior to the event in question and addresses the question of “whether” the event took place—making it similar <i>to</i> the planned interviews the author discusses.
<br><br>
Option C: a senator who is about to vote on an important bill.
<br>
  Incorrect. This interview addresses “whether” the event took place—making it similar <i>to</i> the planned interviews discussed by the author; it is also probably also intended to get publicity for the senator.
<br><br>
Option D: a national leader who has just participated in a peace conference.
<br>
Incorrect. This interview is likely motivated by the desire for publicity, making it similar <i>to</i> the pseudo-events or planned interviews as discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5.
