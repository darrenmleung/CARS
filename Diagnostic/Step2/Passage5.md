# Passage 5
In the eighties, more paper wealth was generated in New York than in any other city at any other time in human history. Greenmail, junk bonds, leverage, and the precarious liquidity of an overgeared credit economy transformed the art world into the Art Industry. Twenty years before, the idea that any work of art made in the previous century would sell for a million dollars had seemed like science fiction to most people. Today, when someone pays five or ten million for a modern painting, the event rates no more than a sentence or two in the auction reports of _The New York Times_. We have come to take it for granted that art should be alienatingly expensive: It seems normal that its price should violate our sense of decency.

Although art has always been a commodity, it loses its inherent value and its social use when it is treated only as such. To lock it into a market circus is to lock people out of contemplating it. This inexorable process tends to collapse the nuances of meaning and visual experience under the brute weight of price. It is not a compliment to the work. If there were only one copy of each book in the world, fought over by multimillionaires and investment trusts and then hidden in storage, what would happen to one’s sense of literature—the tissue of its meanings that sustains a common discourse? “Where works of art are rare,” young Goethe wrote on first visiting Naples, “rarity itself is a value; it is only when they are common . . . that one can learn their intrinsic worth.” The truth of these words is very nearly lost to us, in a culture wrecked by its own commercialization. What strip mining is to nature, the art market has become to culture.

The art-market boom has been an unmitigated disaster for the public life of art. It has distorted the ground of people’s reaction to painting and sculpture. In 1960, anyone, amateur or expert, could spend an hour or two in a museum without wondering what this Tiepolo, this Rembrandt, this de Kooning might cost at auction. Thanks to the unrelenting propaganda of the art market, this is no longer quite the case, and the imagery of money has been so crudely riveted onto the face of museum-quality art by events outside the museum that its unhappy confusion between price and value may never be resolved.

Moreover, there are many areas in which American museums can no longer buy. They voice a litany of complaints, a wrenching sense of disenfranchisement and weakness, as their once adequate annual buying budgets of two to five million dollars are turned to chicken feed by art inflation. And as the museums’ buying power fades, the public experience of art is impoverished.

American museums have in fact been hit by a double whammy: art inflation and a punitive rewriting, in 1986, of U.S. tax laws, which destroyed most incentives for the rich to give art away. Tax exemption through donations was the basis on which American museums grew, and now it is all but gone, with predictably catastrophic results for the future. Thus, in a historic fit of legislative folly, the government began to starve its museums just at the moment when the art market began to paralyze them.

  <summary>Question 24</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: the commercialization of art limits the public’s access to culture.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to identify the function within the passage of a piece of evidence. The question requires you to understand which of the author uses this example to support (after assessing whether these are indeed points the author argues in the passage).
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: we have come to assume that art is prohibitively expensive.
<br>
Incorrect. This option conveys a point made in the first paragraph: “We have come to take it for granted that art should be alienatingly expensive.” The example of a commodity market in books, in the second paragraph, is not intended to clarify this point, which is a straightforward point, not in need of “clarification.”
<br><br>
Option B: society’s notion of the value of art has changed in the past few decades.
<br>
Incorrect. This is not the point of the second paragraph; it is one of the points made explicitly in the first paragraph, and it is not clarified by the example about books.
<br><br>
Option C: New York has become the world center of cultural commercialization.
<br>
Incorrect. The point in this option is not really a point made by the author. The author does describe the “vast amount of paper wealth generated in New York” (first paragraph) and the relation between this growth in wealth and the explosive growth in the price of art, but the author does not suggest that New York has become the “world center of cultural commodification.” This is too much to assume from the first paragraph. Nor does the hypothetical example of treating books as “rare” items clarify any point about the role of New York in the art market.
<br><br>
Option D: the commercialization of art limits the public’s access to culture.
<br>
Correct. The hypothetical example of the commodity market in books, as described in paragraph 2, makes the point that "To lock…[art] into a market circus is to lock people out of contemplating it" (paragraph 2). Just like treating books as “rare” commodities, “fought over by multimillionaires and investment trusts and then hidden in storage” (paragraph 2), limits people’s access or opportunity to engage with books, so, in the author’s view, does the commodity market in art do the same,

  <summary>Question 25</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: actions of the U.S. government have harmed museums.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents hypothetical information not discussed in the passage and asks you to assess the impact of that information on the passage argument. In this case, it asks you to determine which of the author’s points would be weakened by the information.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: actions of the U.S. government have harmed museums.
<br>
Correct. The author says that one of the “hits” experienced by American museums is due to U.S. tax laws, which have "destroyed most incentives for the rich to give art away" (paragraph 5), so if gifts by the rich to art museums <i>increased</i>, this claim would be weakened.
<br><br>
Option B: a credit economy has transformed the art world.
<br>
Incorrect. The author does not make this assertion.
<br><br>
Option C: the public’s reaction to modern art has been distorted.
<br>
Incorrect. The author claims that the public's reaction to modern art has been distorted because of the art market boom, not because of gifts given or not given to art museums, so any increase in such gifts would not weaken this claim.
<br><br>
Option D: as a museum’s buying power decreases, public appreciation of art also decreases.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author does make this assertion (paragraph 4), it is not weakened by an increase in gifts, because gifts don't have anything to do with a museum's buying power.

  <summary>Question 26</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: I and III only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to demonstrate understanding of a causal claim made explicitly by the author.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: II only
<br>
Incorrect. Option II is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: I and II only
<br>
Incorrect. Although option I is correct, the author does not make any claims to support option II.
<br><br>
Option C: I and III only
<br>
Correct. Option I is explicitly supported in the passage: "The art-market boom has…distorted the ground of people’s reaction to painting and sculpture. In 1960, anyone, amateur or expert, could spend an hour or two in a museum without wondering what this Tiepolo, this Rembrandt, this de Kooning might cost at auction. Thanks to the unrelenting propaganda of the art market, this is no longer quite the case…" (paragraph 3). Option III is supported by the fourth paragraph: "…there are many areas in which American museums can no longer buy…" (paragraph 4).
<br><br>
Option D: I, II, and III
<br>
Incorrect. Although options I and III are supported, option II is not.

  <summary>Question 27</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: cannot afford to buy as many works

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify a specific causal claim made by the author in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: have no budget with which to buy new works.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage suggests that museums have a reduced budget to purchase new works due to inflation (paragraph 4). To say that they have “no budget” is to make a claim more extreme, or sweeping, than what is justified by the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: must pay higher insurance on their collections.
<br>
Incorrect. This is neither mentioned nor implied in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: must shorten their viewing hours.
<br>
Incorrect. This is neither mentioned nor implied in the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: cannot afford to buy as many works
<br>
Correct. The author explicitly supports this statement: "…as the museums' buying power fades, the public experience of art is impoverished" (paragraph 4).

  <summary>Question 28</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Most people have no interest in the cost of the paintings they see in museums.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to consider statements or scenarios that are not addressed in the passage and assess how these statements would affect (in this case, “weaken”) passage arguments. This question asks you to consider how additional information would affect the passage itself—or to incorporate outside information into the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Most people have no interest in the cost of the paintings they see in museums.
<br>
Correct. This would challenge the argument that when art is a commodity, "it loses its inherent value and its social use" (paragraph 2) and "The art-market boom has been an unmitigated disaster for the public life of art. It has distorted the ground of people's reaction to painting and sculpture" (paragraph 3), because if people had no interest in the cost of the paintings they see in museums, their reactions to art would not be distorted by these prices, and art would not have lost its inherent value.
<br><br>
Option B: Museums have begun raising funds to supplement their buying power.
<br>
Incorrect. This would not change the authors argument that the commodification of art has distorted people's reactions to it and has made it lose its value.
<br><br>
Option C: There are only about a thousand paintings that have sold for more than ten million dollars.
<br>
Incorrect. This fact would not change the influence or effect of the art market, which is the author's concern in the passage.
<br><br>
Option D: A nineteenth-century painting recently sold for less than a million dollars.
<br>
Incorrect. As a single, decontextualized, example, this would not weaken or challenge the author’s overall argument about the effect of rising art market prices. And we have no idea whether the price paid for this work of art represents a significant increase over its earlier value.
