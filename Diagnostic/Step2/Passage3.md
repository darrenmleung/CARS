# Passage 3
In Edouard Manet’s remarkable painting, _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_, the instability of vision that his pictorial strategy imposes on the viewer mimics the artist’s own bodily weakness, transforming his tremulous gait and uncertain balance into a psychological reaction experienced by the spectator. But the complex perspectival system serves another key purpose: It forces the viewer to participate psychologically in the artist’s growing awareness of the tenuousness of the lifeline that bound him to his mortal existence. As he struggled to complete his last major project, Manet finally abandoned the disavowal and splitting off that had characterized his previous response to his illness. On the deepest—perhaps unconscious—level, the multiple viewpoints represented in _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_ symbolize the newfound ability of Manet the artist to evaluate his situation from multiple perspectives and to accept, at last, the imminence of his own death.

The barmaid, Suzon, represents aspects of the artist’s past, present, and future. Like his beautiful model, whose psychological isolation from her surroundings has been the source of so much scholarly puzzlement, Manet then existed in a limbo—still _in_ this world, but no longer _of_ it, increasingly distanced from everyone and everything that he had once held dear by the inexorable approach of death. Suzon stares blankly at the implied customer standing before her (who, although transparent to the viewer, appears enigmatically in the mirror behind her, an indistinct reflection, like the nearby crowd). Suzon, like her creator, is oblivious, dwelling apart. The detachment that had once been part of Manet’s deliberately assumed public persona had now become his lifeline, enabling him to maintain his integrity and dignity, no matter what his private turmoil, and to continue fulfilling his assumed role as witness to, and recorder of, the contemporary scene.

Whether Manet, who was ostensibly a Roman Catholic, believed in a personal immortality remains uncertain. Whatever his private religious convictions, the artist, like any dying person, was surely preoccupied with the central facts of being and renunciation and the increasing irrelevance to these facts of the world and its ties. These preoccupations impregnated the very canvas of _A Bar at the Folies-Bergère_, which gradually evolved into a document teeming with references to Manet’s life and, above all, to his concern with his reputation, the judgment posterity would make regarding his role as an artistic innovator.

Although the painting abounds with encoded personal allusions, it is the figure of the “real” barmaid that served as Manet’s principal alter ego. Presented in the guise of a simple working girl, in her symmetrical, wrist-forward pose and central placement in the foreground of the composition, this figure recalls conventional images of the Christ figure in Western art. The barmaid, whose inwardness suggests the sad serenity of a messiah contemplating the supreme sacrifice, constitutes Manet’s final symbolic self-portrait. Her suggestion of a life-in-death status signals the completion of his earthly mission and prefigures his imminent passage into history. Indeed, an indirect reference to ascension to an exalted state may well be intended in the trapeze artist in the uppermost corner of the painting, indicated by only her ankles and feet. Just as the Christian disciples watched their savior disappear from earthly view, we witness her escape from the confines of the framed composition. Like the Christ concept, Manet saw himself as destined to live on as a master. His corpus of paintings constituted his legacy to artists of the future and would consolidate his reputation as a pioneer of that new religious order, Modernism.

  <summary>Question 13</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: inconsistencies in the viewpoint presented.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify a central and explicit causal claim made in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: his failure to carry the project to completion.
<br>
Incorrect. Although the passage refers to Manet's “struggle . . . to complete his last major work” (first paragraph), the author writes that it is "the instability of vision" in that final work that mimics his bodily weakness, not his failure to complete the work. Further, given the passage reference to the “remarkable painting” that Manet produced, there is no suggestion that he did not, in fact, ultimately complete the painting.
<br><br>
Option B: his adoption of a loose painting technique.
<br>
Incorrect. The author refers to Manet’s “tremulous gait and uncertain balance” as hallmarks of his illness, and as elements that he “transform[s] into a psychological reaction experienced by the spectator” (first paragraph). But this is not the same as indicating that Manet’s painting style is “loose,” as this option would have it.
<br><br>
Option C: inconsistencies in the viewpoint presented.
<br>
Correct. The author says that Manet's “bodily weakness” is mimicked by the "instability of vision" (first paragraph) in his last work. At the end of the paragraph, we are told exactly what that instability of vision, or that “complex perspectival system,” consists of—"the multiple viewpoints represented in the" painting; this matches the "inconsistencies in the viewpoint" described by this option.
<br><br>
Option D: the representation of a squalid bar scene.
<br>
Incorrect. Although perhaps plausible, the author says that Manet's bodily weakness is mimicked by the "instability of vision" in the painting, putting the spectator into a position similar to that occupied by Manet. Although the painting is set in a bar, the passage does not describe the bar as “squalid,” nor use language to imply that it is that kind of setting.

  <summary>Question 14</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Suzon’s head as seen from behind.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to use information in the passage and apply it to derive information not present in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a self-portrait of Manet in the crowd.
<br>
Incorrect. The author contends that Suzon (the figure in the painting) "represents aspects of the artist's past, present, and future" (paragraph 2), so there would be no need for Manet to paint himself into his painting. Furthermore, "the painting abounds with encoded personal allusions" (paragraph 4), suggesting the author’s view that Manet wants to present himself indirectly, in an “encoded” fashion,” rather than overtly in a self-portrait. The barmaid,” the author writes, “constitutes Manet's final symbolic self-portrait.”
<br><br>
Option B: Suzon’s head as seen from behind.
<br>
Correct. The passage describes the customer standing before Suzon in the painting as appearing “<i>in the mirror behind her</i>” (paragraph 2); surely, then, the back of her head would also appear in the mirror.
<br><br>
Option C: the costume of the trapeze artist.
<br>
Incorrect. The trapeze artist, in the “uppermost corner of the painting,” is "indicated by only her ankles and feet" (paragraph 4). Thus, there is no reason to believe that her costume would be visible.
<br><br>
Option D: the back of Suzon’s customer.
<br>
Incorrect. Suzon's customer appears in the mirror behind her, as "an indistinct reflection" (paragraph 2); that would be the front of the customer, so it would be highly unlikely that the customer's back would also appear in the painting.

  <summary>Question 15</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Manet learned early in life that he had a terminal illness.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it presents a hypothetical scenario not included in the passage and asks you to consider what information (again hypothetical information) would allow you to reconcile the passage with the new scenario. In other words, it asks you to assess the effect of new information on the passage itself.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Manet learned early in life that he had a terminal illness.
<br>
Correct. The author argues that the painting conveys Manet’s struggle with "the tenuousness of the lifeline that bound him to his mortal existence" (first paragraph) and the "inexorable approach of death" (first paragraph), referring specifically to "his illness" and its symptoms (first paragraph). This argument would not hold unless Manet had known of his terminal illness at the time of its painting, as this option describes.
<br><br>
Option B: Manet painted scenes at the Folies-Bergère throughout his career.
<br>
Incorrect. Manet’s previous experiences painting the same real-life setting would be irrelevant to the passage thesis (which is that the painting conveys Manet's struggle with illness and impending death).
<br><br>
Option C: A concern with perspective was apparent in Manet’s early work.
<br>
Incorrect. If Manet had experimented with multiple perspectives early in his career, this would make less, not more, feasible the passage argument that these perspectives represented Manet’s ability to “accept, at last, the imminence of his own death” (first paragraph). This option suggests that the multiple perspectives represented in the painting would not be emblematic of the struggle in a late period of his life.
<br><br>
Option D: The artist who painted A Bar at the Folies-Bergère was not Manet.
<br>
Incorrect. This information would make the passage thesis—that the painting encodes Manet’s “personal” struggles and preoccupations--completely incorrect, so it is certainly not necessary for the thesis to be feasible.

  <summary>Question 16</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: concern with his influence on later art.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to identify the author’s use of a rhetorical structure (in this case, the metaphor of resurrection) and to infer from the meaning or purpose of that rhetorical structure in the context of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: symbolization of himself as a trapeze artist.
<br>
Incorrect. The author says explicitly that “an indirect reference to ascension to an exalted state may well be intended in the trapeze artist in the uppermost corner of the painting” (final paragraph). In other words, the author suggests that the painting may use the trapeze artist to <i>symbolize</i> “ascension to an exalted state.” This does not support the claim that the author invokes the metaphor of resurrection (or rebirth) to symbolize a trapeze artist.
<br><br>
Option B: concern with his influence on later art.
<br>
Correct. The question asks what the author may intend by using the metaphor of resurrection (or rebirth). The passage invokes this metaphor: "Like the Christ concept, Manet saw himself as destined to live on as a master. His corpus of paintings constituted his legacy …" (final paragraph). This option, then, clearly invokes the metaphor of resurrection (“like the Christ concept”) to suggest that Manet imagined he would live beyond his death as a result of the influence of his body of work.
<br><br>
Option C: hope for the restoration of his health.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage implies Manet's acceptance of death; his concern was with "his reputation, the judgment posterity would make regarding his role as an artistic innovator" (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option D: faith in the prospect of eternal life.
<br>
Incorrect. The author is not making a claim about Manet’s personal beliefs (“whether Manet … believed in a personal immortality remains <i>uncertain</i>" (paragraph 3). Rather, he uses the metaphor of rebirth to describe Manet’s preoccupation with his artistic legacy.

  <summary>Question 17</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: It weakens it by suggesting external influences on Manet’s style and subject matter.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it introduces a hypothetical scenario that is not addressed in the passage and asks you to consider the impact of this scenario on passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: It strengthens it by showing that Manet’s views on mortality were common in his culture.
<br>
Incorrect. If Manet’s views on mortality were common in his culture, this wouldn’t strengthen the passage argument that his approach to his own impending mortality influenced his art.
<br><br>
Option B: It strengthens it by suggesting that Manet’s approach to painting was a product of his time.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage suggests that Manet’s approach to painting was deeply personal, and that he hoped that his work would live on as an example of artistic innovation--that he would “live on as a Master” (final paragraph). If Manet was simply a “product of his time,” and others had been painting the same subjects and approaches as Manet was during his lifetime, this would weaken, rather than strengthen, the argument about his personal, innovative approach.
<br><br>
Option C: It weakens it by showing the prevalence of Manet’s interest in representing modern life.
<br>
Incorrect. Whether or not others shared Manet's interest in representing modern life is irrelevant to the argument that this work conveys Manet's struggle with his illness and impending death.
<br><br>
Option D: It weakens it by suggesting external influences on Manet’s style and subject matter.
<br>
Correct. The passage argues that Manet's style and subject matter were due to his personal circumstances and imminent death, but this option suggests he may have been influenced by an artistic trend of his time. If this were true, it would weaken the personal and psychological argument the author makes when he says, for instance: “On the deepest—perhaps unconscious—level, the multiple viewpoints represented in <i>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</i> symbolize the newfound ability of Manet the artist to evaluate his situation from multiple perspectives and to accept, at last, the imminence of his own death” (first paragraph).
