# Passage 4
Liberalism is not a tidily political concept. Like socialism, it had its intellectual roots in the social philosophy of the eighteenth century and derived its modern shape in the political ferment of early nineteenth-century Europe.

Although not inherently dependent on or even concerned with ideas about human rights (natural or otherwise), it soon became bound to a certain conception of these rights, which have been called _individual liberties_. These are universal claims on the community by the individual—rights or freedoms that belong to people not because they have a certain place in society or are citizens but just because they are autonomous human beings, whose claim is superior to that of laws or the preferences of others.

If such rights are assumed, they can be challenged or reduced only on very specific grounds: because they conflict with the identical rights of other persons or with the interests of all. The object of laws and constitutions when individual liberties conflict would be to protect these rights. Government would have no greater purpose—certainly none that overrode the very rights that it existed to defend.

This is an idealized account of liberalism. With time, its meaning in Britain and the United States diverged radically from its meaning in Continental Europe. While the value of individual liberties was a basic aspect of the Anglo-American political philosophy, the term _liberalism_, especially in the U.S., gradually became associated with ideas to the left of mainstream politics—loosely, those favoring government-provided social benefits. It acquired a quite different sense in countries such as Italy and Germany, where a _Liberal_ is now someone who supports freedoms that favor the industrial and commercial elite.

But it was above all in France that _liberalism_ lost any association with the political stance of the left. There, popular opposition to individual liberties that protected the privileged, a situation attributed to a liberal revolution, fused with social criticism of the early effects of industrialization to produce a new rights language, superficially in the tradition of its predecessor but in fact decisively at variance with it.

This development is apparent in the French Constitution of 1848. Rights in that document are not only exclusively a matter of citizenship (there is no reference to “human rights”) but refer specifically to the collective interests of socially determined entities (citizens, workers, children, families, and so on). Moreover, the rights that citizens are assumed to possess are uniquely _claim rights_—services such as education and public assistance provided in return for the performance of social duties. _Rights_, that is, became a term that implied a social project.

Inherent in this conception of rights are two assumptions. First, politics is to be replaced by a science of society. The purpose of government is to reduce the space between what should be and what is. That space—its complexity, its injustice, and its inadequacy—is seen not as something inherent in any society but as the historical (and thus transcendable) result of a class struggle produced by an essentially elitist revolution. Claims by the groups constituting society thus arise from the very divisions and imperfections in the social order that government exists to reduce and ultimately to abolish.

The second assumption of the political language of France is that the drive to overcome inequities attributed to the Revolution must of necessity be at the expense of personal freedom. For many political theorists, an insistence on individual liberties was no longer the solution; it was, in fact, the problem.

  <summary>Question 18</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: The right to emergency medical care

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply a distinction or definition that is provided in the passage to a new situation.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The right to emergency medical care
<br>
Correct. The author describes claim rights as "services such as education and public assistance provided in return for the performance of social duties" (paragraph 6); emergency medical care could be considered a "public assistance" service.
<br><br>
Option B: The right to a speedy trial
<br>
Incorrect. The author defines claim rights as "services such as education and public assistance provided in return for the performance of social duties" (paragraph 6); a speedy trial is less of an instance of "public assistance" than is "emergency medical care" and is not really a "service".
<br><br>
Option C: The right to defend one’s life
<br>
Incorrect. The author defines claim rights as "services such as education and public assistance provided in return for the performance of social duties" (paragraph 6); self-defense cannot be considered a service.
<br><br>
Option D: The right to state one’s beliefs
<br>
Incorrect. The author defines claim rights as "services such as education and public assistance provided in return for the performance of social duties" (paragraph 6); stating one's beliefs cannot be considered a service.

  <summary>Question 19</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: the legacy of past injustices.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question that tests your understanding of the author’s discussion of a central point in the passage--the author’s representation of the viewpoint of French political scientists--then asks you to make an inference about how those political scientists would regard a particular phenomenon.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: necessary for the protection of individual liberties.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage concludes, speaking of France, that "For many political theorists, an insistence on individual liberties was no longer the solution; it was, in fact, the problem" (final paragraph); this clearly implies that the hypothesized French political scientist would not believe that individual liberties need to be protected.
<br><br>
Option B: evidence of ineffective national leadership.
<br>
Incorrect. The author indicates that French political scientists see political conflict as part of the work required to achieve a more equitable society. The author does not suggest that this kind of conflict represents “ineffective” national leadership: “Claims by the groups constituting society thus arise from the very divisions and imperfections in the social order that government exists to reduce and ultimately to abolish” (paragraph 7). That the government exists “ultimately to abolish” those imperfections suggests that the political scientists do not expect government to have achieved this yet.
<br><br>
Option C: an aspect of a moral social system.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option. If anything, paragraph 7 suggests the reverse.
<br><br>
Option D: the legacy of past injustices.
<br>
Correct. The author describes an assumption of the “political language of France”: “The purpose of government is to reduce the space between what should be and what is. That space—its complexity, its <i>injustice</i>, and its inadequacy—is seen not as something inherent in any society but as the historical (and thus transcendable) result of a class struggle produced by an essentially elitist revolution. <i>Claims by the groups constituting society thus arise from the very divisions and imperfections in the social order</i> that government exists to reduce and ultimately to abolish” (paragraph 7, emphasis added).

  <summary>Question 20</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: Individual liberties are superior to laws or preferences.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to reflect on the nature of the evidence presented, to evaluate whether the evidence is potentially verifiable, or whether it is potentially a matter of subjective opinion.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Liberalism became associated with individual liberties.
<br>
Incorrect. This would be a matter of historical record.
<br><br>
Option B: Individual liberties are superior to laws or preferences.
<br>
Correct. This option contains a statement that is a matter of opinion, not empirically testable, so a reader would be unable to confirm the truth of this.
<br><br>
Option C: The Constitution of 1848 used the term rights in a new way.
<br>
Incorrect. This is a matter of historical record and thus a fact that one could verify.
<br><br>
Option D: The value of individual liberties is widely questioned.
<br>
Incorrect. This is something that could be confirmed by reading discussions of the topic; wide questioning could certainly be verified.

  <summary>Question 21</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: suppressed protest strikes by workers.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to take a passage explanation or definition (in this case, of liberalism in Continental Europe) and apply that to new situations, which are not discussed in the text.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: favored equality of opportunity.
<br>
Incorrect. This option is not supported by the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: opposed the concept of individual liberties.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates that “liberalism” as it is understood in Italy and Germany (as opposed to in France) would support the concept of individual liberties.
<br><br>
Option C: provided low-rent housing for the poor.
<br>
  Incorrect. The passage says "in countries such as Italy and Germany…a <i>Liberal</i> is now someone who supports freedoms that favor the industrial and commercial elite" (paragraph 4); a liberal government would therefore not be likely to support providing low-rent housing for the poor.
<br><br>
Option D: suppressed protest strikes by workers.
<br>
Correct. This option receives support from paragraph 4: "in countries such as Italy and Germany … a <i>Liberal</i> is now someone who supports freedoms that favor the industrial and commercial elite"; these freedoms would include suppressing protest strikes by workers, who would be challenging the industrial and commercial elite.

  <summary>Question 22</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: They are used to justify social inequities.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to make an inference based on the author’s description.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: They are used to justify social inequities.
<br>
Correct. The passage refers to "popular opposition to individual liberties that protected the privileged…" (paragraph 5). If such liberties protected the privileged, they would have, similarly, justified social inequities.
<br><br>
Option B: They do not in fact protect individuals.
<br>
Incorrect. On the contrary, the passage says they "protected the privileged" (paragraph 5), and the privileged <i>are</i> individuals.
<br><br>
Option C: They disregard the claims of minority groups.
<br>
Incorrect. Remember that the stem asks about the French position on the <i>opposition</i> to individual liberties. The passage indicates that the opposition stemmed from a belief that individual liberties “protected the privileged (paragraph 5). Thus, the popular French belief is not that opposition to individual liberties disregards the claims of minority groups; it is that a concern for individual liberties disregards those claims.
<br><br>
Option D: They are the impractical ideals of social scientists.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.

  <summary>Question 23</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: acquired radically different meanings in the U.S. and in Continental Europe.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it begins with information that is not included in the passage and asks you to determine how this information affects passage arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: acquired radically different meanings in the U.S. and in Continental Europe.
<br>
Correct. This option is supported by the passage: "It [liberalism] acquired a quite different sense in countries such as Italy and Germany, where a <i>Liberal</i> is now someone who supports freedoms that favor the industrial and commercial elite" (paragraph 4). By contrast, according to the question stem, liberals in the U.S. would be people who believed that the government should provide social services (not necessarily benefitting the industrial and commercial elite).
<br><br>
Option B: soon became closely bound to the concept of individual liberties.
<br>
Incorrect. The author tells us that liberalism became “bound to a certain conception of . . individual liberties” in the context of nineteenth-century Europe (paragraph 2). The point about what liberalism and conservatism mean in the contemporary U.S. does not demonstrate anything about the linkage of liberalism and liberties in the nineteenth century.
<br><br>
Option C: developed its modern form in the political ferment of the early nineteenth century.
<br>
Incorrect. The first and second paragraphs talk of the development of liberalism and individual liberties in the political ferment of the early nineteenth century, not of the idea that governments should provide various public services.
<br><br>
Option D: in the U.S. supports a view of government that is not widely shared in France.
<br>
Incorrect. We don’t know whether the French perspective on liberalism is “widely shared” in France; we only know that that French perspective diverges from the U.S. perspective.
