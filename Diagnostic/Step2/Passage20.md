# Passage 20
Around midnight, a small sea-battered sailboat ghosted her way toward Newport, Rhode Island, hugging the shore. The Spanish-American War was raging, but the helmsman reckoned he would be safe in shoal water. No warship would risk staving its bow on the rocks beneath the surface. Peering into darkness and listening for the sounds of shallow water, he worked the boat into the inner harbor, then slept the sleep of the dead. The boat was Spray, and her skipper, Joshua Slocum, had just become the first person to sail alone around the world. It was 1:00 a.m., June 27, 1898.

The journey had taken more than three years and covered 46,000 miles. With only a compass, old charts, a sextant, a hunk of lead on a line to measure depth, and a windup clock, Slocum had faced huge seas, deadly currents, jagged reefs, pirates, uncertain receptions, and stark loneliness for months on end, a feat requiring extraordinary reserves of discipline and energy. It was a historic moment, to be celebrated a century later in harbors around the world.

But in 1898, America was too busy becoming a world power to notice. Only a local reporter noted that Spray had come home. Buried beneath news of the war, the story made page 3 of the June 28th _Newport Herald_. One problem was that people were skeptical. Sail across the world’s oceans alone in a crude wooden boat with only rudimentary equipment? Impossible! “There are sailors who won’t go south of Newport without radar, loran, depth sounder, G.P.S., and other electronic gear,” said one expert recently. “It’s not surprising that people a hundred years ago were skeptical.” It was only when they could examine Slocum’s meticulous logs and Spray’s papers, which had been stamped in twenty-odd countries around the world that the doubters believed him.

Slocum had already been around the world five times on bigger ships, and he judged Spray as seaworthy as those. His plan had been to circle the globe west to east. But at Gibraltar, British naval officers warned him that the Mediterranean was swarming with pirates that season. A small ship sailed by a single man would not have a chance. So back he headed across the Atlantic. There were, he reasoned, two directions in which to sail around the world.

Perhaps he created his own luck. Endurance, an uncanny ability to read the sea, and a sense of contentment with himself and his ship were key ingredients. Slocum sailed at times for more than seventy days at a stretch. He had invited his wife to join him, but she had declined. Says Judith Lund of the New Bedford Whaling Museum, “Sailors these days often have autopilots, radios, phones, e-mail, computers, emergency locator beacons -- even V.C.R.s for entertainment. It’s hard for us to imagine just how totally cut off Slocum was.”

In Australia, Slocum conceived the idea of financing his voyage by lecturing and allowing people to board and examine Spray. Soon, wherever he put into port, the news of his exploits preceded him. He delighted in surprising people, demonstrating that he was a man of letters (although he had never been educated beyond the third grade), not just a dirty old sailor. As a writer, he was deemed by some a “sea-locked Thoreau.” On the day that Slocum set sail he wrote, “The [sunlight was] clear and strong ... and the Spray, making good her name as she dashed ahead, snatched necklace after necklace from the sea, and as often threw them away.”

# Questions
### 111. Suppose that another navigator in another sailboat, Pearl, completed a solo circumnavigation of the globe in 1899. Which of the following items of information would most diminish Slocum’s achievement?
<ol type="A">
  <li>Pearl was smaller than Spray.</li>
  <li>Pearl capsized three times.</li>
  <li>Pearl was intercepted by pirates.</li>
  <li>Pearl reached home in under three years.</li>
</ol>

### 112. The passage implies that a solitary navigator today would be less subject than one of Slocum’s time to:
<ol type="A">
  <li>a shortage of funds.</li>
  <li>piracy and enemy attacks.</li>
  <li>the loneliness of isolation.</li>
  <li>hazardous weather conditions.</li>
</ol>

### 113. The passage offers NO information that would help the reader to understand:
<ol type="A">
  <li>the reason that no one met Slocum at the harbor in Newport.</li>
  <li>the means by which Slocum could navigate uncharted waters.</li>
  <li>the author’s certainty about the hour of Slocum’s return.</li>
  <li>the way Slocum had become so accomplished a writer.</li>
</ol>

### 114. Part of the reason that Slocum was not welcomed home enthusiastically was that the voyage had lasted nearly twice as long as he had originally anticipated. This loss of time was probably due to the fact that:
<ol type="A">
  <li>his route took him across the Atlantic three times.</li>
  <li>he needed his wife’s help to keep the boat on course.</li>
  <li>he had difficulty in earning enough money to continue.</li>
  <li>navigational equipment that failed was hard to replace.</li>
</ol>

### 115. The description of Slocum as a “sea-locked Thoreau” (final paragraph) meant that he:
<ol type="A">
  <li>felt as Thoreau did about the beauty of the sea.</li>
  <li>had a narrower range of topics than did Thoreau.</li>
  <li>tried with some success to emulate Thoreau’s style.</li>
  <li>wrote as well about the sea as Thoreau did about the land.</li>
</ol>

# Answers

  <summary>Question 111</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Pearl was smaller than Spray.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it introduces new information that is not discussed in the passage and asks you to integrate it into the passage to see how it would affect passage information.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Pearl was smaller than Spray.
<br>
Correct. First of all, “Slocum had already been around the world five times on bigger ships (paragraph 4). And he had been discouraged by those who told him: "A small ship . . . would not have a chance" (paragraph 4). This clearly suggests that the ship’s small size made the trip more impressive, so if another, even smaller, ship had made the same trip, that would indeed diminish Slocum's achievement.
<br><br>
Option B: Pearl capsized three times.
<br>
Incorrect. If Pearl had capsized three times, this would not necessarily make Slocum’s achievement less impressive; perhaps he handled Spray better than Pearl’s captain handled Parl.
<br><br>
Option C: Pearl was intercepted by pirates.
<br>
Incorrect. We don't know if Spray was ever intercepted by pirates (we only know that pirates were one of the dangers, as mentioned in paragraph 2), so we don't know if the fact that Pearl was intercepted by pirates would affect Slocum's achievement. Further, as the author writes: “Perhaps [Slocum] created his own luck” (paragraph 5), so if he avoided pirates, this may have added to his achievement rather than potentially diminished it.
<br><br>
Option D: Pearl reached home in under three years.
<br>
Incorrect. Slocum’s trip took more than three years, but the passage emphasizes his “endurance” (paragraph 5) and ability to endure isolation for great stretches of time (in paragraphs 2 and 5), so if Pearl had made the journey more quickly, this would not necessarily diminish Slocum’s achievement.

  <summary>Question 112</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: the loneliness of isolation.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to locate a suggestion the author makes explicitly in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: a shortage of funds.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support for this option in the passage. The final paragraph suggests that Slocum did not experience a shortage of funds ("In Australia, Slocum conceived the idea of financing his voyage by…"), and the author offers no view about whether it would be more or less likely for a navigator today to experience such a shortage.
<br><br>
Option B: piracy and enemy attacks.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not offer enough information about the relative degree of risk from piracy and enemy attacks faced by Slocum and by a solitary navigator today to allow us to choose this option.
<br><br>
Option C: the loneliness of isolation.
<br>
Correct. The passage clearly supports this option: “Says Judith Lund of the New Bedford Whaling Museum, ‘Sailors these days often have autopilots, radios, phones, e-mail, computers, emergency locator beacons -- even V.C.R.s for entertainment. It’s hard for us to imagine just how totally cut off Slocum was’ (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: hazardous weather conditions.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage does not offer enough information about weather conditions for Slocum and for a solitary navigator today to allow us to choose this option.

<details>
  <summary>Question 113</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: the way Slocum had become so accomplished a writer.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to assess what kind of information or evidence is necessary to help the reader understand a particular question, then locate that evidence (or the lack of evidence, in this case) in the text.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: the reason that no one met Slocum at the harbor in Newport.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage provides this: "But in 1898, America was too busy becoming a world power to notice" Slocum’s arrival (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option B: the means by which Slocum could navigate uncharted waters.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage provides this: "With only a compass, old charts, a sextant …" (paragraph 2).
<br><br>
Option C: the author’s certainty about the hour of Slocum’s return.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage provides this: Slocum had a "windup clock" with him (paragraph 2), and he kept “meticulous logs” (paragraph 3).
<br><br>
Option D: the way Slocum had become so accomplished a writer.
<br>
Correct. The passage says Slocum had become an accomplished writer (final paragraph) but provides no explanation regarding the way he did so.

  <summary>Question 114</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: his route took him across the Atlantic three times.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it provides information that is not included in the passage and asks how passage information would help to explain that novel information.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: his route took him across the Atlantic three times.
<br>
Correct. The author explains: "But at Gibraltar, British naval officers warned him that the Mediterranean was swarming with pirates…So back he headed across the Atlantic…" (paragraph 4). This means that Slocum crossed the Atlantic from Rhode Island to the UK, then he crossed back, then kept going around the world, which meant he would have crossed it a third time to get back to Rhode Island.
<br><br>
Option B: he needed his wife’s help to keep the boat on course.
<br>
Incorrect. Slocum’s wife is mentioned in paragraph 5 and in that context, it can be inferred that Slocum invited her along for company, not for navigation.
<br><br>
Option C: he had difficulty in earning enough money to continue.
<br>
Incorrect. "In Australia, Slocum conceived the idea of financing his voyage by lecturing and allowing people to board and examine Spray…" (final paragraph).
<br><br>
Option D: navigational equipment that failed was hard to replace.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no mention in the passage of failed navigational equipment that would be difficult to replace.

  <summary>Question 115</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: wrote as well about the sea as Thoreau did about the land.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to infer the meaning of a phrase as it is used in a specific context in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: felt as Thoreau did about the beauty of the sea.

Incorrect. This does not explain "sea-locked,” which does not suggest a perception of “beauty” in the sea as much as it suggests a sense of being confined to or isolated on the sea.

Option B: had a narrower range of topics than did Thoreau.

Incorrect. There is no support for this option in the passage.

Option C: tried with some success to emulate Thoreau’s style.

Incorrect. The passage does not discuss Slocum’s style or any attempt to emulate Thoreau’s style.

Option D: wrote as well about the sea as Thoreau did about the land.

Correct. The author writes that Slocum “delighted in surprising people, demonstrating that he was a man of letters…not just a…sailor. As a writer, he was deemed by some a ‘sea-locked Thoreau.’ On the day that Slocum set sail he wrote, ‘The [sunlight was] clear and strong.…..and the Spray, making good her name as she dashed ahead, snatched necklace after necklace from the sea, and as often threw them away’” (final paragraph). The reference to Slocum as a “man of letters” and as a “writer,” as well as the poetic final sentence he writes about the sea, all work together to suggest that “a sea-locked Thoreau” is meant as a laudatory term comparing Slocum to another writer. do. The term characterizes Slocum as a writer whose work is presumably done on the sea and is clearly about the sea; the adjective “sea-locked” before Thoreau allows you to infer that Thoreau must <i>not</i> have been sea-locked, making this option correct.
