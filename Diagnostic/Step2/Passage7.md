# Passage 7
As U.S. manufacturers fight to stay alive, they find it hard to compete with the products coming out of low-wage countries. The result: Fewer and fewer jobs are available to blue-collar workers in the manufacturing sector, and the ones that do exist generally pay poorly. Modestly skilled workers can either hold onto those bargain-basement jobs or bolt to the service sector, where they’ll probably find jobs that pay no better. The further result: A declining standard of living for the entire country as well as a crop of social problems brought on by the inability of a large, fast-growing segment of society to make a decent wage.

Everybody says better trained workers would make the nation competitive again. Hence, the call by the federal Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce that we must upgrade the skills of American workers if we are to stop the U.S. economic decline and succeed in the global marketplace.

What is this “high-performance workplace” everybody says is needed? Any faithful student of current management theory will recognize its attributes. People generally work in teams; they’re cross-trained, lightly supervised, and empowered to make decisions that used to be reserved for the bosses. They often operate equipment incorporating state-of-the-art computer technology, which prods the company to reorganize work and to upgrade workers’ skills in order to achieve the efficiency the technology accords. Consequently, high-performance workplaces employ fewer people than they did before they were reorganized, and productivity per person is higher.

All well and good, you say, but if companies that want to create these high-performance workplaces mostly need well trained, computer-literate workers, why is so much of the talk on this issue about the lack of basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic? Answer: That’s the ante. One of the reasons executives resist retraining and reorganization is that they believe it will take too much time and effort to remake employees—with no guarantee of success.

Tom Lindsley, of the National Alliance of Business, says that executives find it just too daunting to have to lay the groundwork of reading, writing, and arithmetic before they can even begin to teach employees new skills that arise from the latest technology or work reorganization. The fact is, the status quo is a powerful force. Most companies concentrate on the short term. It’s a focus encouraged by Wall Street, as well as by government policies and by tax laws, that—for instance—allow tax breaks for a fancy new building but not for teaching employees new skills that would allow the company to become more productive.

Consequently, most companies don’t abandon the low-skills, low-wage path until they have no other option. Even so, there’s no guarantee that an impending catastrophe will divert companies onto the high-wage, high-skills path. The business pages are littered with stories of companies that respond to adversity by asking for wage concessions from their workers or moving production out of the country.

Another reason that companies stay on the low-wage, low-skills path is similar to the barrier presented by their workers’ lack of basic skills. Employers simply don’t know how to go about reorganizing work to create these high-performance workplaces. This lack of knowledge about the way to change, combined with the expense and time necessary to provide remedial training, is a one-two punch for most businesses.

  <summary>Question 37</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: avoid retraining employees than to retrain them.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it tests your understanding of a quotation or phrase within the specific part of the passage in which it appears, asking you to use context to understand what the author refers to with this phrase.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: make an existing worker more productive than to hire more workers.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option B: avoid retraining employees than to retrain them.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "The fact is, the status quo is a powerful force. Most companies focus on the short term. It's a focus encouraged by Wall Street, as well as by government policies and by tax laws, that—for instance—allow tax breaks for a fancy new building but not for teaching employees new skills…" (paragraph 5): the status quo is focus on the short term, and retraining employees is a 'focus on the long term' endeavor.
<br><br>
Option C: move production to a foreign country than to create a high-performance workplace.
<br>
Incorrect. Moving production out of the country is described in paragraph 6 as a response to impending catastrophe, but not as a belief that is due to the status quo.
<br><br>
Option D: maintain an ineffective system of tax breaks than to modify such a system.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage refers to tax laws as helping to maintain the status quo, by encouraging a short-term view, but the statement about the power of the status quo does not refer to a belief simply about the tax laws.

  <summary>Question 38</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: new buildings do not help to increase workers’ productivity.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question because it asks you to make inferences about the assumptions that underlie a specific statement of the author’s in a discrete part of the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: most employees are unaware of the tax breaks their employers receive.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no discussion of this topic in the passage.
<br><br>
Option B: the government revenue lost because of tax breaks for businesses would be better spent on the educational system.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option C: new buildings represent a long-term commitment of resources.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage indicates the opposite: new buildings represent attention to the short-term (paragraph 5).
<br><br>
Option D: new buildings do not help to increase workers’ productivity.
<br>
  Correct. The author writes that laws “allow tax breaks for a fancy new building <i>but not for</i> teaching employees new skills that would allow the company to become more productive" (paragraph 5). This suggests that new buildings would <i>not</i> increase productivity.

  <summary>Question 39</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: increasing unemployment, at least for a short period.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question because it asks you to apply passage arguments to make a prediction about a new scenario that is not described in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: creating workers who only understand their own highly specialized jobs, thus reducing communication between workers.
<br>
Incorrect. The passage describes the high-performance workplace as one with teams (paragraph 3), consisting of people who are "cross-trained" (paragraph 3), both of which suggest, if anything, <i>increasing</i> communication between workers.
<br><br>
Option B: making businesses ineligible for tax breaks they had formerly enjoyed.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no point, implicit or explicit, in the passage, that would provide support for this option.
<br><br>
Option C: reducing wages for unskilled workers, at least for a short period.
<br>
Incorrect. The description in the passage implies that the high-performance workplace does not employ unskilled workers (paragraph 3); furthermore, there is no link made in the passage between high-performance workplaces and wages in other workplaces (that is, those that do employ unskilled workers).
<br><br>
Option D: increasing unemployment, at least for a short period.
<br>
Correct. The author writes: "…high-performance workplaces employ fewer people than they did before they were reorganized" (paragraph 3), so that would mean they increase unemployment, at least in the short term.

  <summary>Question 40</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: nationally only.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Comprehension question, which asks you to make an inference about the author’s meaning, based on other passage statements.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: nationally only.
<br>
  Correct. The passage focuses on <i>U. S.</i> manufacturers, which is clear throughout the passage, including from references in the first and second paragraphs.
<br><br>
Option B: internationally.
<br>
  Incorrect. The passage focuses on <i>U. S.</i> manufacturers, as is apparent even from the opening sentence.
<br><br>
Option C: gradually.
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for this option.
<br><br>
Option D: primarily in the service sector.
<br>
  Incorrect. The passage focuses on the problems that face U. S. <i>manufacturers</i> (first paragraph). While the service sector may seem to offer an alternative, those who end up in the service sector: will “probably find jobs that pay no better (first paragraph). The author does not recommend implementing the “high-performance workplace” in the service sector.

  <summary>Question 41</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: I and III only

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to evaluate the position of several different entities or experts within the text relative to a particular claim.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: II only
<br>
Incorrect. There is no support in the passage for the claim that workers in manufacturing agree with what “everybody says” about training workers.
<br><br>
Option B: III only
<br>
Incorrect. Although III is correct, so is I.
<br><br>
Option C: I and III only
<br>
  Correct. The author writes: "<i>Hence</i>, the call by the federal commission…" (paragraph 2), following the sentence that describes what "[e]verybody says…." This makes I correct. The third paragraph supports III: “What is this “high-performance workplace” everybody says is needed? Any faithful student of current management theory will recognize its attributes.
<br><br>
Option D: II and III only
<br>
Incorrect. Although III is correct, there is no support in the passage for II.

  <summary>Question 42</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: unemployed, modestly skilled persons.

  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question because it asks you to integrate information from across the paragraph to figure out who the passage is most likely attempting to address. Be especially aware of the negative stem.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: unemployed, modestly skilled persons.
<br>
Correct. Since the passage does not offer unemployed, modestly skilled persons any information on which to act, it is probably not written primarily for them.
<br><br>
Option B: federal government officials.
<br>
Incorrect. Paragraph 2 resonates with federal government officials (and to the extent that they may be able to contribute to solving the problem, the passage may interest them).
<br><br>
Option C: corporate managers in the manufacturing sector.
<br>
Incorrect. The first and second paragraphs identify a problem no doubt familiar to many corporate managers in the manufacturing sector. Paragraph 3 speaks of a solution to their problem, and paragraphs 4-7 raise objections to that solution, making the passage of great interest to corporate managers in the manufacturing sector.
<br><br>
Option D: students of management.
<br>
Incorrect. Given that the passage introduces a problem that can ostensibly be addressed by management, then presents a solution, then discusses objections to that solution, the passage seems very much intended for students of management.
