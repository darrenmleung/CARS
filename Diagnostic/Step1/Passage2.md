# Passage 2
In _The Two Cultures,_ C. P. Snow argued that humanists are profoundly ignorant of the methods and results of science and that to a nearly equal extent scientists are ignorant of the humanities. But there is more to the difference between the two cultures than mere ignorance. Scientists and humanists use different rules for evaluating arguments. The philosopher Stephen Toulmin claims that rules of reasoning are “field-dependent, and . . . the merits to be demanded of an argument in one field will be found to be absent . . . from entirely meritorious arguments in another.”

The great philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, “All human thinking is essentially of two kinds—reasoning on the one hand, and narrative, descriptive, contemplative thinking on the other.” In _Actual Minds, Possible Worlds_, Jerome Bruner describes the same two modes of thinking: the “paradigmatic” and the “narrative.” According to Bruner, paradigmatic reasoning is scientific: systematic, objective, and logical. Narrative thought is humanistic: literary, intuitive, and interpretive. He describes narrative thought as having a “logic” of its own, different from the logic of science. People who

> follow the logic of drama (that is, who act like storytellers) [use] a different strategy, one that takes account of the context in which behavior occurs rather than focusing only on general tendencies, on behavior in a vacuum. [They are] constructing a reality of characters involved in particular actions in particular settings, operating “realistically” too, but in another reality. They are like those literary [critics] who operate from the bottom up to construct a “reality” of this poem or that novel.

To Bruner, these two modes are not only different, they are “irreducible to one another”:

> Each of the ways of knowing has operating principles of its own and its own criteria of well-formedness. They differ radically in their procedures for verification. Arguments convince one of their truth, stories of their lifelikeness. The term then functions differently in the logical proposition “if x, then y” and in the narrative recit “The king died, and then the queen died.”

If narrative (humanistic) and paradigmatic (scientific) modes of inquiry are irreconcilable, then assessment of works in one mode by the standards of the other are bound to be unfair. Good stories do not necessarily make good science. Marxism, for example, whatever its merits as an economic theory, is nevertheless a convincing story of the origins and consequences of the struggle between socioeconomic classes. Likewise, Freudian psychoanalytic theory has been called unscientific by some scientists, but is a convincing story of how conflicts with parents become conflicts within individuals.

Conversely, good research articles do not make good stories. By de-emphasizing the writer’s character, motives, and hindsight, scientific conventions for reporting research disguise the truth: Scientists seldom conduct research in the order suggested by the form of the research article. They do not first review literature, then formulate hypotheses, determine strategies for testing them, and finally gather and interpret data, in that order. A research project may begin with any of these activities, and scientists often engage in several of them at the same time. Only afterward do they rearrange their thoughts according to the conventions of scientific exposition.

# Answers

  <summary>Question 6</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: Plausible examples and descriptions of differences between stories and scientific theories
  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question, particularly about evidence and support for this statement in the passage. When we read the options, we can see that in many ways it is describing what the author did in this passage to support their arguments.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: The fact that a large number of scholars believe this statement
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author uses quotes to show agreement with this statement, simply the fact that some people can be found who agree with a claim does not provide very strong support, and the author does not ask us to endorse this claim simply because anyone said so.
<br><br>
Option B: The fact that some humanists and scientists agree with this statement
<br>
Incorrect. Although the author uses quotes to show agreement with this statement, simply the fact that some people can be found who agree with a claim does not provide very strong support, and the author does not ask us to endorse this claim simply because anyone said so.
<br><br>
Option C: Plausible examples and descriptions of differences between stories and scientific
<br>
Correct. As the author did in the passage, identifying a key difference and using examples to illustrate it helps to clarify the argument.
<br><br>
Option D: A demonstration that paradigmatic thinking is more difficult than narrative thinking
<br>
Incorrect. This option includes the assertion that one form is “more difficult” than the other. This is not consistent with the argument made in the passage that part of being “irreconcilable” (paragraph 4) means that the two cannot be compared in anyway (including in terms of their difficulty). Such a demonstration would not support that they are “irreconcilable.” It would show the opposite—that they are reconcilable.

  <summary>Question 7</summary>
  <b>The solution is D</b>: support the claim that scientists and humanists use differing methods.
  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Within the Text question. This question prompt is asking about the author’s purpose for using several quotations. The author did not state their reasoning explicitly in in the passage, so this is assessing our ability to infer the author’s intent, using information from multiple places in the text. 
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: challenge the theory that paradigmatic and narrative thought are irreconcilable.
<br>
Incorrect. This option suggests that the author uses these quotations because they “challenge” that the two modes of inquiry are irreconcilable. This is the opposite of how they are used. They are used to show support for the point that they are irreconcilable. 
<br><br>
Option B: support Snow’s notion that humanists and scientists are ignorant of one another’s methods.
<br>
Incorrect. This option suggests they are used to support the claim that humanists and scientists are ignorant of the other’s methods. The author does not provide any support for that claim in the passage.
<br><br>
Option C: challenge the idea that humanistic works cannot be judged by scientific standards.
<br>
Incorrect. This option suggests that the author uses these quotes to “challenge” the idea that humanistic works cannot be judged by scientific standard. This is the opposite of a point made by the author. The author is not challenging this claim and does not use these quotes to challenge it.
<br><br>
Option D: support the claim that scientists and humanists use differing methods.
<br>
Correct. This option asserts that the quotes are used to support the claim of differing methods. This is a claim included by the author, and it is a claim that is supported by the quotes.

  <summary>Question 8</summary>
  <b>The solution is C</b>: professional training.
  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question. When we look at the response options, we can see they are not things that were mentioned in the passage. We need to determine which of these responses are the most justifiable extensions from the way the author wrote about this topic.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: personalities.
<br>
Incorrect. What this question seems to come down to is what the author thinks is responsible for the differences between humanists and scientists. Looking at paragraph 1, it casts the difference as being due to culture. The rest of the paragraph implies that the culture comes from the field, so we are looking for an option related to how individuals become enculturated in their field. Personalities are not as directly linked to one’s field as professional training.
<br><br>
Option B: childhood experiences.
<br>
Incorrect. We are looking for an option related to how individuals become enculturated in their field, but childhood experiences are not as directly linked to one’s field as professional training.
<br><br>
Option C: professional training.
<br>
Correct. We are looking for an option related to how individuals become enculturated in their field. Personalities, childhood experiences, and lifestyles are not as directly linked to one’s field as professional training.
<br><br>
Option D: lifestyles.
<br>
Incorrect. We are looking for an option related to how individuals become enculturated in their field, but lifestyles are not as directly linked to one’s field as professional training.

  <summary>Question 9</summary>
  <b>The solution is B</b>: are based on firm scientific evidence.
  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question. This question is asking what would happen in a hypothetical situation (“…if it could be proven...”), and how that would alter the author’s argument. We need to integrate new hypothetical ideas back into the argument made in the passage to figure out which would make the examples “lose some relevance.” It is asking us to think about what new information about Marxism and Freudian theory would undermine the argument made in the text.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: contradict one another.
<br>
Incorrect. The content of the theories is irrelevant, so it would not matter if the two theories contradict each other.
<br><br>
Option B: are based on firm scientific evidence.
<br>
Correct. If both Marxism and Freudian theory were found to be based on firm scientific evidence, then they would no longer be good examples of theories that make “good stories” but bad science. This would make these examples lose their relevance. Another way of thinking about this is asking what point are those theories currently used to support? Right now, Marxism and Freudian theories are used as examples of theories that make good stories but may not make good science, so we are looking for the option that represents the opposite of this point (or would otherwise weaken this point). 
<br><br>
Option C: are essentially unscientific.
<br>
Incorrect. If it were found that the theories were essentially unscientific, this would not alter the existing argument. That is essentially already the argument.
<br><br>
Option D: obey the conventions of good stories.
<br>
Incorrect. Similarly, if the two theories were shown to be good stories, that also would not alter the existing argument.

  <summary>Question 10</summary>
  <b>The solution is A</b>: Historians practice a mode of thinking that is neither paradigmatic nor narrative.
  <br><br>
  <b>Item Rationale:</b><br>
  This is a Reasoning Beyond the Text question, specifically assessing our ability to integrate new information back into the logic of the argument stated in the passage. The question prompt is asking us to consider what new information “if true” would weaken the argument made in the passage.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Option Rationale:</b><br>
  Option A: Historians practice a mode of thinking that is neither paradigmatic nor narrative.
<br>
Correct. This question prompt is asking us which statement is “LEAST damaging,” meaning that three of the statements will weaken the argument, and the best answer will be the one that does not. In some ways, the point in this option about historians not fitting into either way of thinking could be damaging if we knew whether historians should be considered as scientists or humanists, or if the author claims there can’t be a third way of thinking. But it could also not be damaging if the author never discusses historians or limits the argument to there being only two modes of thought. Even if we have an opinion about whether we think historians are humanists or scientists, or even if we actually know the opinion of the author or the stance that one of the cited authors would take, unless it is in the passage, we can’t use it to make my decision.  So, we will first look in the passage to see if there is any language that suggests whether the author would consider historians to be humanists or scientists.  We don’t see anything about historians per se, but we do see that James said that “…all human thinking is essentially of two kinds” (paragraph 2). This means that a third mode of thinking would be a problem for James. But the author never actually endorses this. What the author most clearly advocates is that “assessment of works in one mode by the standards of the other are bound to be unfair,” so this option does not seem to weaken the author’s argument. Based in this reasoning, this option is the best response in terms of something that is LEAST damaging to the author’s argument.
<br><br>
Option B: Writing novels and plays often requires systematic, objective thinking.
<br>
Incorrect. Novelists and playwrights do seem like individuals that the author would consider as part of the humanist category based in references to “drama” and “storytellers” (paragraph 2), so it is a problem if their craft requires “scientific” thought processes. This option would weaken the argument and is not a viable response.
<br><br>
Option C: Scientific research often requires intuitive, interpretive thinking.
<br>
Incorrect. Following the same logic, it seems like a problem if scientific research requires “humanistic” thought processes, so this option would weaken the argument and is not a viable response.
<br><br>
Option D: There are major differences in method within the humanities and sciences.
<br>
Incorrect. It seems like it might be a problem if there are “major differences” in methods within the two broad fields. Modifiers like “major” are important to notice. Sometimes picking the best answer may hinge on modifiers like “major” or “minor” in questions (as well as terms like “all” or “few” or “none”). In this case, the author’s main argument seems to be that the standards of one mode cannot and should not be used to evaluate the other, but this implies that the standards are fair to apply within a mode. It seems like if there are major differences in method within the humanities and sciences then it would be difficult to have standards, and this would weaken the author’s argument.
